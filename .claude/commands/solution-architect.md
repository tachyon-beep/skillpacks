# Using Solution Architect

## Overview

**Solution Architect produces forward design artifacts from a brief / HLD / epic / brownfield change.**

This pack is the forward-design counterpart to the backward-looking Axiom pair:

- `axiom-system-archaeologist` → documents existing code (neutral)
- `axiom-system-architect` → assesses existing architecture (critical)
- **`axiom-solution-architect` (this pack)** → designs new/changed solutions (forward)

## When to Use

Use solution-architect skills when:

- You have a business brief, HLD, epic, or brownfield change request
- You need a traceable artifact set (not a one-off diagram or ad-hoc ADR)
- The design will be reviewed, handed off, or implemented by another team
- The context is enterprise (TOGAF phases, ArchiMate tooling, ARB submission)
- User asks: "Design me a solution for…" / "Take this brief and architect it" / "What artifacts do we need for this?"

Do **not** use this pack when:

- You are assessing an existing system → use `/system-architect`
- You are documenting an existing system → use `/system-archaeologist`
- You need process governance (branching, CI/CD, ADR lifecycle) → use `/sdlc-engineering`

## How to Access Reference Sheets

All reference sheets are in the same directory as this `SKILL.md`. When you see a link like `[quantifying-nfrs.md](quantifying-nfrs.md)`, read the file from the same directory.

## The Pipeline

```
archaeologist (docs) → architect (assesses) → (future) project-manager
                                 ↑
solution-architect (designs) ────┘  (solution-architect output can later
                                    be critiqued by system-architect)
```

## Expected Artifact Set

The pack produces numbered artifacts in a `solution-architecture/` workspace:

| # | Artifact | Producer |

| 00 | `scope-and-context.md` | `triaging-input-maturity` |
| 01 | `requirements.md` | `triaging-input-maturity` |

## Catalog-Level Guidance for Router-Owned Artifacts

For artifacts produced under router guidance (no dedicated skill), follow these rules:

### C4 views (07, 08)

- **Context diagram (07):** users, external systems, and the system-under-design. One box for the system. No internal detail.
- **Container diagram (08):** the system broken into deployable/runnable units (services, databases, queues, front-ends). Show technology labels (e.g., "PostgreSQL 16", "FastAPI"). Keep to one page.
- Skip component and code-level diagrams unless specifically requested — they duplicate `09-component-specifications.md` and rot fast.
- One diagram per purpose. Do not produce five overlapping diagrams.

### Component specifications (09)

Per component: name, responsibility (one sentence), public interface, dependencies (components it calls), consumed NFRs (which NFRs it is load-bearing for — cross-reference `03-nfr-mapping.md`), and requirement IDs it satisfies. The `maintaining-requirements-traceability` skill checks this cross-referencing.

### Data model (10)

Entities + relationships + ownership (which service/bounded-context owns which entity). Include cardinality and lifecycle notes where non-obvious. Avoid ORM-specific schema; stay at the logical level.

### Interface contracts (11)

Machine-readable where possible (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Protobuf, GraphQL SDL). If prose, include: method/operation, inputs, outputs, errors, idempotency, versioning stance.

### Sequence diagrams (12)

One per critical scenario (happy path + notable failure paths). PlantUML or Mermaid source checked in. Do not produce one per endpoint — pick the 3-5 scenarios that actually reveal design tension.

### Deployment view (13)

Target environments, runtime topology, scaling posture, regions/zones, network boundaries. This is the operations/SRE handoff surface.

## Routing

### Scenario: "Design me a solution for X"

1. Read the input. Use: `triaging-input-maturity` → `00-scope-and-context.md`, `01-requirements.md`, workflow plan
2. Use: `quantifying-nfrs` → `02-`, `03-`
3. Use: `resisting-tech-and-scope-creep` → `04-`, `05-`, `06-`
4. Produce router-owned artifacts (`07-13`) following catalog guidance above
5. Use: `writing-rigorous-adrs` as decisions arise throughout → `adrs/`
6. Use: `maintaining-requirements-traceability` → `14-`
7. Use: `designing-for-integration-and-migration` → `15-`, (`16-` if brownfield), `17-`
8. If enterprise context: use `mapping-to-togaf-archimate` → `archimate-model/`, `togaf-deliverable-map.md`
9. Use: `assembling-solution-architecture-document` → `99-`

### Scenario: "Critique this design package"

Use the `solution-design-reviewer` agent via `/review-solution-design`.

### Scenario: "Is Kafka the right choice for this?"

Use the `tech-selection-critic` agent. Red-teams a tech choice against requirements and constraints.

## Integration with Other Skillpacks

### Security (ordis-security-architect)

```
Solution architect produces 02 (NFRs), 04 (overview), 09 (components)
→ ordis-security-architect reads these, produces threat model + controls
→ Threats feed back into 17 (risk-register) and adrs/
```

### Documentation (muna-technical-writer)

```
Solution architect produces 99-solution-architecture-document.md
→ muna-technical-writer polishes for target register (exec, technical, public, policy)
```

### SDLC governance (axiom-sdlc-engineering)

```
Solution architect produces adrs/
→ axiom-sdlc-engineering/design-and-build manages ADR lifecycle + governance
```

### Brownfield input (axiom-system-archaeologist)

```
Archaeologist produces 01-discovery-findings.md, 02-subsystem-catalog.md
→ Solution architect's triage consumes these as input context
→ No duplicate analysis
```

### Domain packs

Consult during tech selection:

- `yzmir-ml-production` → ML-serving tech choices
- `axiom-web-backend` → API framework choices
- `axiom-rust-engineering` / `axiom-python-engineering` → language-level patterns

## Decision Tree

```
Do you have a design brief / HLD / epic / change request?
├─ No → Clarify input with user first
└─ Yes → Continue

Is this brownfield (modifying existing system)?
├─ Yes → Is there archaeologist output for the system?
│         ├─ No → Consider running /system-archaeologist first
│         └─ Yes → triaging-input-maturity consumes it
└─ No (greenfield) → triaging-input-maturity

Does the context mention TOGAF, ArchiMate, ARB, phase gates?
├─ Yes → Activate mapping-to-togaf-archimate in the workflow
└─ No → Keep TOGAF/ArchiMate binding out of the workflow
```
