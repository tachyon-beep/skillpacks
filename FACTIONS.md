In a world transformed by the Confluence, where reality itself has become unstable and the laws of physics rewritten, humanity relies on six powerful factions to navigate the Tumult and rebuild civilization. Each faction brings its own philosophy, methodology, and vision for humanity's future.

**Our skillpacks draw inspiration from these factions** - organizing professional expertise through the lens of their distinct approaches to mastering a changed world.
