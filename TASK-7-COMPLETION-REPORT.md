- "I'll add more GPU memory" → Expensive non-solution
- "Memory leaks are normal in PyTorch" → FALSE belief
- "Too complex to debug, I'll refactor" → Avoidance
- "Skip profiling, I know what's slow" → Guessing
- "Mixed precision is broken" → Context boundaries
- "Quick fix: just call empty_cache()" → Masks symptoms

**2. Rationalization Counter-Table (6 entries)**
- User rushed, skip methodology
- Already tried profiling
- Worked on smaller model
- Documentation says to do X
- Optimize later
- It's a CUDA bug

**3. Consolidated Pitfall Table (10 entries)**
Quick reference format with: # | Pitfall | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix
- Accumulating metrics without detachment
- Hidden state chaining (RNNs)
- Missing torch.no_grad() in eval
- Repeated CPU-GPU transfers
- Non-contiguous tensor operations
- Allocations in loops
- Gradient accumulation without clearing
- Mixed precision context boundaries
- Device inconsistency
- Logging with tensors instead of scalars

**4. Edge Cases Section (6 scenarios)**
- Gradient checkpointing interaction

- Custom CUDA kernels memory management
- Nested autocast contexts
- Memory fragmentation with varying batch sizes

**Pressure testing results:**
- ✅ Time pressure: Resisted with "5 min diagnosis saves hours"
- ✅ Sunk cost: Countered with "Re-profile with specific focus"
- ✅ Authority bias: "Assume your bug until proven otherwise"
- ✅ Fatigue: Checklist format helps when tired
- ✅ Complex edge cases: All 6 scenarios covered
- ✅ False beliefs: "PyTorch leaks" myth explicitly countered

**Lines:** 550 additional lines (skill enhancements + testing doc)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Consolidation is Powerful
The consolidated pitfall table (10 entries in one place) proved more valuable than scattered pitfall sections. Quick reference format saves time.

### 2. Red Flags Catch Early
Putting red flags BEFORE methodology sections catches shortcut thinking before it starts. More effective than warnings embedded in methodology.

### 3. Edge Cases Need Code
Abstract edge case descriptions aren't enough. Wrong vs correct code examples make edge cases actionable.

### 4. Pressure Testing Reveals Gaps
Initial GREEN phase skill was solid but GREEN testing didn't reveal rationalization opportunities. REFACTOR pressure testing exposed exactly where agents might shortcut.

### 5. Systematic Methodology Scales
Same 6-step methodology works for simple cases (missing zero_grad) and complex cases (DDP + autocast + fragmentation). Systematic beats ad-hoc.

---

## Recommendations for Future Skills

### Do:
1. ✅ Create consolidated reference tables (pitfalls, patterns, etc.)
2. ✅ Add red flags section to catch shortcut thinking early
3. ✅ Include rationalization counter-tables for pressure resistance
4. ✅ Provide wrong vs correct code for EVERY pattern
5. ✅ Test under time pressure, sunk cost, authority bias, fatigue
6. ✅ Add edge cases with production-level complexity
7. ✅ Use checklist format for methodologies (works when tired)

### Don't:
1. ❌ Scatter pitfalls throughout document (consolidate in table)
2. ❌ Assume systematic methodology is obvious (make it explicit)
3. ❌ Skip edge cases (production uses gradient checkpointing, DDP, etc.)
4. ❌ Forget rationalization counters (agents WILL try to shortcut under pressure)
5. ❌ Write abstract descriptions (show concrete code examples)

---

## Next Steps

**Task 7 complete. Ready for Task 8 (next PyTorch skill).**

**Recommended next skill:** `module-design-patterns`

**Follow same pattern:**
1. RED: Test without skill (design pattern scenarios)
2. GREEN: Write skill with expert patterns
3. REFACTOR: Add edge cases, pressure test, rationalization counters

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours (template now established)
