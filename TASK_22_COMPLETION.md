### Skill Architecture

**Part 1: Overfitting Detection Framework**
- Clarifying questions (5 key diagnostic questions)
- Decision tree for diagnosis
- Red flags (8 warning signs)
- Gap-based severity classification (< 3%, 3-10%, 10-20%, > 20%)

**Part 2: Regularization Techniques (8 methods)**
1. Early stopping (patience parameter tuning)
2. L2 regularization / weight decay (strength scaling by dataset size)
3. Dropout (architecture-specific placement and strength)
4. Batch normalization (stability and mild regularization)
5. Label smoothing (soft targets, class count dependency)
6. Data augmentation (domain-specific guidance)
7. Model capacity reduction (fundamental fix)
8. Cross-validation (K-fold for small datasets)

**Part 3: Combining Multiple Techniques**
- Decision framework (root cause → primary fix → secondary fixes)
- Anti-patterns (throwing everything at problem, conflicting techniques)
- Systematic combination strategy (baseline → +1 technique → measure → +2nd technique)

**Part 4: Architecture-Specific Strategies**
- CNNs: early stopping → L2 → augmentation → capacity reduction
- Transformers: early stopping → L2 → label smoothing → augmentation
- RNNs/LSTMs: early stopping → dropout → L2 → augmentation + recurrent dropout
- Anti-patterns for each

**Part 5: Common Pitfalls (10)**
- Documented with user rationalization, reality, evidence, and fix
- Proactively addresses misconceptions

**Part 6: Red Flags & Troubleshooting**
- 8 red flags with immediate actions and diagnosis checklists
- Complete troubleshooting flowchart
- Systematic debugging approach

**Part 7: Rationalization Table**
- 10 common beliefs vs reality
- Evidence for each correction
- Specific fixes for each misconception

**Part 8: Complete Example**
- ResNet50 on 5K images, 35% train/val gap
- Step-by-step diagnosis through fixes
- Final result: 35% gap → 2% gap
- Demonstrates: Technique combination, measurement, systematic improvement

**Part 9: Advanced Topics**
- Mixup and Cutmix (advanced augmentation)
- Class imbalance handling (weighted sampling, loss weighting)
- Validation set leakage (proper train/val/test split)
- Learning curves (monitoring strategy, interpretation)
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search with cross-validation)
- Debugging checklist (13 comprehensive items)
- Common code patterns (2 complete training loops with regularization)

### RED Phase: Baseline Failures (4 documented)

1. **Only Looking at Training Accuracy**
   - Scenario: ResNet50 on CIFAR-100, train 98%, val 62% (unknown)
   - Rationalization: "Train accuracy is what matters"
   - Why it fails: Overfitting invisible without validation
   - Expected pressure: User will resist checking validation until shown evidence

2. **Using Only Dropout, No Other Regularization**
   - Scenario: Overfitting present, adds dropout=0.5 everywhere
   - Rationalization: "Dropout is the regularization"
   - Why it fails: Wrong technique or wrong strength, causes underfitting
   - Expected pressure: User applies it once, gets worse results, gives up

3. **No Early Stopping (Training Too Long)**
   - Scenario: Best validation at epoch 50, still training to 200
   - Rationalization: "More training always helps"
   - Why it fails: Overfitting worsens, training loss ≠ validation loss
   - Expected pressure: User wasted 3x compute training overfitted model

4. **Adding Regularization Without Measuring Effect**
   - Scenario: Adds L2 once, measures once, doesn't systematically tune
   - Rationalization: "L2 is standard, defaults should work"
   - Why it fails: Strength is hyperparameter, must be tuned
   - Expected pressure: Doesn't measure, assumes regularization doesn't work

### GREEN Phase: Success Criteria

- ✅ 1,508 lines of comprehensive guidance
- ✅ All 8 techniques with implementation and tuning guidance
- ✅ 20+ working code examples
- ✅ 10 pitfalls documented with rationalizations
- ✅ 10-item rationalization table
- ✅ 8 red flags with troubleshooting
- ✅ Decision frameworks for detection and combination
- ✅ Architecture-specific guidance (CNNs, Transformers, RNNs)
- ✅ Complete troubleshooting flowchart
- ✅ Measured improvements documented
- ✅ Expected outcomes by dataset size

### REFACTOR Phase: Pressure Testing (11 scenarios)

1. **User insists training accuracy alone shows quality** → Teaches importance of validation metric
2. **User applies heavy dropout and underfits** → Teaches systematic strength tuning
3. **User trains 500 epochs instead of 50** → Teaches early stopping necessity
4. **User adds L2, dropout, augmentation all at once** → Teaches systematic combination
5. **User doesn't have validation set** → Teaches validation as essential prerequisite
6. **User gets different validation accuracy each run** → Teaches cross-validation for stability
7. **User sees accuracy drop with augmentation** → Teaches augmentation strength tuning
8. **User reduces capacity but still overfits** → Teaches multi-technique approach
9. **User removes batch norm to fix overfitting** → Teaches batch norm role in stability
10. **User compares models on different datasets** → Teaches regularization strength scaling
11. **User measures only final test accuracy** → Teaches importance of learning curves

Each scenario demonstrates:
- Skill guidance through diagnosis (not just prescription)
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Handling user resistance
- Systematic solutions
- Measurement-focused approach

## Critical Concepts Covered

1. **Overfitting is a gap metric** - Not just high training accuracy
2. **Root causes differ, fixes must match** - Capacity, data size, duration, learning rate all different
3. **Regularization strength matters** - Must be tuned systematically, scales with dataset size
4. **Multiple techniques work better** - Combination > single strong technique
5. **Architecture matters** - CNNs, Transformers, RNNs need different approaches
6. **Measurement before prescription** - Detect and diagnose before applying fixes
7. **Validation is essential** - Can't diagnose without it
8. **Early stopping saves compute** - Improves accuracy and saves training time
9. **Capacity reduction is fundamental** - Not a complete fix but essential for large model/small data
10. **Learning curves are diagnostic** - Train/val gap patterns reveal problem type
