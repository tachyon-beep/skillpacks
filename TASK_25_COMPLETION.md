# Task 25 Completion Report: Experiment Tracking Skill

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the **experiment-tracking skill** for the training-optimization pack. This is the **FINAL skill in Phase 1B**, completing 11/11 skills (100% of Phase 1B).

---

## Deliverables

### 1. RED Phase (240 lines)
**File**: `source/yzmir/training-optimization/experiment-tracking/RED.md`

Four baseline failure scenarios:
1. **Not tracking until results lost** - User gets best result but can't reproduce
2. **Tracking metrics without hyperparameters** - 50 experiments, no context
3. **Print statements instead of logging** - Training crashes, all data lost
4. **No artifact versioning** - Overwriting checkpoints, evaluation bug discovered

Key insight: Track before you need it - retroactive tracking is impossible.

**Commit**: `b19876b` - "feat: Add RED phase for experiment-tracking skill"

### 2. SKILL.md + GREEN Phase (1,989 + 218 lines)
**Files**: 
- `source/yzmir/training-optimization/experiment-tracking/SKILL.md`
- `source/yzmir/training-optimization/experiment-tracking/GREEN.md`

#### Core Principles (5)
1. Track before you need it (can't add retroactively)
2. Complete tracking = 5 categories (hyperparams, metrics, artifacts, code, environment)
3. Tool selection framework (local vs team vs production)
4. Minimal overhead (1-5%, not 50%)
5. Organization matters (naming, tagging, grouping)

#### Tool Integration
- **TensorBoard**: Local, simple (2 lines of code setup)
- **Weights & Biases**: Team collaboration, cloud-based, best UX
- **MLflow**: Production deployment, self-hosted, model registry

#### Key Sections
- What to track (5 categories with complete checklist)
- Tool comparison table (features, costs, use cases)
- Reproducibility patterns (seeds, git, environment, config)
- Experiment organization (naming conventions, hierarchies)
- Experiment comparison (metrics, hyperparameters, artifacts)
- Collaboration workflows (team dashboards, sharing)
- Advanced patterns (7 sections: sweeps, distributed, resumption, analysis, data versioning, artifacts, alerts)
- Complete production example (ExperimentTracker class, 200+ lines)
- Full training script with tracking (150+ lines)

#### Quality Metrics
- **Lines**: 1,989 (target: 1,500-2,000) ✓
- **Code examples**: 40 (target: 15+) ✓
- **Pitfalls**: 10 (target: 10+) ✓
- **Red flags**: 10 (target: 8+) ✓
- **Rationalization entries**: 12 (target: 10+) ✓

**Commit**: `9ad04e8` - "feat: Implement experiment-tracking skill (RED-GREEN phases)"

### 3. REFACTOR Phase (1,208 lines)
**File**: `source/yzmir/training-optimization/experiment-tracking/REFACTOR.md`

#### Pressure Test Scenarios (13)
1. User doesn't see value in tracking → Show ROI (30s setup vs days lost)
2. Tool choice paralysis → Decision tree (solo/team/production)
3. Reproducibility claims without proper tracking → 5-part checklist
4. Tracking overhead concerns → Show <1% reality
5. Team collaboration without shared tracking → Standardization benefits
6. Poor organization (chaos) → Naming conventions
7. Incomplete tracking (only metrics) → Context required
8. Checkpoint management disaster → Versioning vs overwriting
9. "Just testing" mentality → Murphy's law (best results untracked)
10. Version control resistance → Git state for reproducibility
11. Environment tracking missing → PyTorch/CUDA/GPU versions matter
12. Ignoring failed experiments → Failures teach what NOT to do
13. Collaboration friction → Team standardization

Each scenario includes:
- Setup and initial resistance
- 5 probing questions
- Expected rationalizations
- Reality checks with examples
- Resolution with code

## Key Innovations

### 1. Complete Tracking Framework
Five-category system covering everything needed for reproducibility:
- Hyperparameters (what you're tuning)
- Metrics (how you're doing)
- Artifacts (what you're saving)
- Code version (what you're running)
- Environment (where you're running)

### 2. Tool Selection Decision Tree
Context-dependent framework for choosing tools:
- Solo project → TensorBoard (simplest)
- Team research → W&B (collaboration)
- Production → MLflow (deployment)
- Budget/privacy → Self-hosted options

### 3. Production-Ready ExperimentTracker
Complete class with:
- Multi-backend support (TensorBoard + W&B)
- Git state capture (commit, branch, diff)
- Environment logging
- Checkpoint management
- Figure logging
- Resume support

### 4. Minimal Overhead Philosophy
Guidelines for keeping overhead <1%:
- Log scalars every step (<0.1%)
- Log images every epoch (1-2%)
- Save checkpoints on improvement only (conditional)
- Don't log raw data (use data versioning)

### 5. Team Standardization
Collaboration patterns:
- Shared tracking setup
- Comparison workflows
- Result sharing
- Team dashboards

---

## Impact

### For Solo Developers
- 2-line TensorBoard setup
