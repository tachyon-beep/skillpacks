## Key Routing Dimensions

### 1. Action Space (Primary Classifier)
- **Discrete actions** (< 100) → **value-based-methods** (DQN, Q-learning)
- **Discrete actions** (large/complex) → **policy-gradient-methods** (PPO, REINFORCE)
- **Continuous actions** → **actor-critic-methods** (SAC, TD3, PPO)
- **CRITICAL RULE**: DQN NEVER for continuous actions ✅

### 2. Data Regime (Critical Constraint)
- **Online learning** (agent interacts) → Standard algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC)
- **Offline learning** (fixed dataset) → **offline-rl** (CQL, IQL) ONLY
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Standard algorithms FAIL on offline data ✅

### 3. Experience Level
- **New to RL** → **rl-foundations** (MDP, Bellman, value/policy)
- **Experienced** → Direct to algorithm skills

### 4. Special Problem Types
- **Multiple agents** → **multi-agent-rl** (QMIX, MADDPG)
- **Sample efficiency critical** → **model-based-rl** (MBPO, Dreamer)
- **Sparse rewards** → **reward-shaping** + **exploration-strategies**

### 5. Infrastructure & Debugging
- **"Not learning"** → **rl-debugging** (FIRST, before algorithm changes)
- **Exploration issues** → **exploration-strategies**
- **Environment setup** → **rl-environments**
- **Evaluation questions** → **rl-evaluation**

## Core Principle

**"Problem type determines algorithm family."**

RL is not one algorithm. The correct approach depends on:
1. Action space (discrete vs continuous)
2. Data regime (online vs offline)
3. Experience level (foundations vs implementation)
4. Special requirements (multi-agent, model-based, exploration, reward design)

**Always clarify the problem BEFORE suggesting algorithms.**

## Critical Rules Enforced

### Rule 1: DQN for Discrete Actions ONLY
- **Never** suggest DQN for continuous action spaces
- Discretization is suboptimal (loses precision, explodes action space)
- Continuous → actor-critic-methods (SAC, TD3)
- Enforced in: Scenarios 2, 8 (REFACTOR)

### Rule 2: Offline Data Requires Offline-RL
- **Never** use online algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC) on fixed datasets
- Distribution shift and bootstrapping errors cause failure
- Must use Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) or Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)
- Enforced in: Scenarios 3, 8 (REFACTOR)

### Rule 3: Debug Before Changing Algorithms
- 80% of "not learning" issues are bugs, not wrong algorithm
- Route to **rl-debugging** first
- Check: reward scale, exploration, network architecture, learning rate
- Only consider algorithm change after ruling out bugs
- Enforced in: Scenarios 5 (RED/GREEN), 5 (REFACTOR)

### Rule 4: Problem Characterization Before Routing
- **Always** ask diagnostic questions
- **Never** guess based on minimal information
- Critical questions: action space? data regime? sample efficiency?
- Enforced in: All scenarios

### Rule 5: PPO is Not Universal
- PPO is general-purpose but not optimal for all cases
- Discrete + small action space → DQN simpler
- Continuous + sample efficiency → SAC better
- Offline data → PPO doesn't work at all
- Enforced in: Scenarios 7 (RED/GREEN), 1, 2, 4, 8 (REFACTOR)

## Testing Coverage

### RED Phase (10 Scenarios)
1. Vague request (no problem characterization)
2. DQN trap (continuous actions)
3. Offline data mistake (using online algorithms)

5. "It's not learning" debugging crisis
6. Sparse reward problem
7. PPO cargo cult (assuming universal optimality)
8. Environment setup blocker
9. Sample efficiency crisis
10. Evaluation confusion

### GREEN Phase (10 Verifications)
- All RED scenarios correctly routed ✅
- Diagnostic questions asked ✅
- Routing rationale provided ✅
- 12/12 skills referenced ✅

### REFACTOR Phase (10 Edge Cases)
1. User insists on wrong algorithm (DQN for continuous)
2. Multiple conflicting requirements
3. Vague problem + time pressure
4. Authority pressure (DeepMind paper)
5. Ambiguous symptoms (plateau, multiple causes)
6. Extreme beginner (prediction vs control)
7. Implicit assumptions (minimal info)
8. Multiple red flags (offline + continuous + PPO + deadline)
9. Research context (compare algorithms)
10. Boundary case (text generation, RL vs supervised)

**Total Testing**: 30 scenarios ✅

## Rationalization Resistance

### Rationalization Table (12 Entries)
- "Just use PPO for everything"
- "DQN for continuous actions"
- "Offline RL is just RL on a dataset"
- "More data always helps"

- "Epsilon-greedy is enough for exploration"
- "I'll just increase the reward when it doesn't learn"
- "I can reuse online RL code for offline data"
- "My test reward is lower than training, must be overfitting"

## Pack Boundaries

### When NOT to Use This Pack
- Supervised learning from labeled data → **training-optimization pack**
- Architecture design → **neural-architectures pack**
- PyTorch implementation details → **pytorch-engineering pack**
- Production deployment → **ml-production pack**
- LLM fine-tuning with RLHF → **llm-specialist pack** (though it uses RL concepts)
- Hyperparameter search → **training-optimization pack**
- Custom CUDA kernels → **pytorch-engineering pack**

### Edge Case: RLHF
RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for LLMs uses RL concepts (PPO) but has LLM-specific considerations. Route to **llm-specialist** first; they may reference this pack.

## Diagnostic Question Templates

### Action Space
- "What actions can your agent take? Discrete choices or continuous values?"
- "How many possible actions? Small (< 100), large (100-10000), or infinite (continuous)?"

### Data Regime
- "Can your agent interact with the environment during training, or do you have a fixed dataset?"
- "Are you learning online (agent tries actions) or offline (from logged data)?"

### Experience Level
- "Are you new to RL, or do you have a specific problem?"
- "Do you understand MDPs, value functions, and policy gradients?"

### Special Requirements
- "Are multiple agents involved? Do they cooperate or compete?"
- "Is sample efficiency critical? How many episodes can you afford?"
- "Is the reward sparse (only at goal) or dense (every step)?"
- "Do you need the agent to learn a model of the environment?"

### Infrastructure
- "Do you have an environment set up, or do you need to create one?"
- "Are you debugging a training issue, or designing from scratch?"
- "How will you evaluate the agent?"

## Implementation Highlights

### Routing Decision Tree
5-step framework:
1. **Assess experience level** (foundations needed?)
2. **Classify action space** (discrete vs continuous)
3. **Identify data regime** (online vs offline)
4. **Special problem types** (multi-agent, model-based)
5. **Debugging & infrastructure** (environment, evaluation, debugging)

### Example Routing (from GREEN verification)

**Scenario**: Robot arm with continuous joint angles, 10-minute episodes, 100 episodes/day

**Routing Logic**:
1. Continuous actions → **actor-critic-methods** (SAC for sample efficiency)
2. Sample efficiency critical → Confirms SAC (off-policy, replay buffer)
3. Alternative: **model-based-rl** (MBPO for extreme efficiency)
4. Do NOT use: PPO (on-policy, sample inefficient)

**Explanation**:
> "Sample efficiency is your critical constraint. At 100 episodes/day, you need off-policy algorithms that reuse data. SAC (actor-critic-methods) is most sample-efficient for continuous control. Consider model-based-rl (MBPO) if SAC is still too sample inefficient."

## Key Innovations

### 1. Action Space as Primary Classifier
- Most RL routing focuses on algorithm families
- This skill puts **action space** first (discrete vs continuous)
- Prevents common mistake: DQN for continuous actions

### 2. Offline Data as Critical Constraint
- Offline RL often overlooked in routing
- This skill makes offline data a **primary decision point**
- Routes to offline-rl immediately (CQL, IQL)
- Prevents wasted time with online algorithms on offline data

### 3. Debug-First Philosophy
- Most routing suggests algorithm changes
- This skill routes to **rl-debugging** first when "not learning"
- 80% of issues are bugs, not wrong algorithm
- Saves time by systematic debugging before algorithm switching

### 4. PPO De-Cargo-Culting
- Challenges "PPO is best" assumption
- Explains when PPO is suboptimal (discrete small action space, sample efficiency, offline)
- Teaches problem-based algorithm selection

### 5. Multi-Skill Scenarios
- Recognizes complex problems need multiple skills
- Routes to 2-3 skills with priorities
- Example: Sparse reward → reward-shaping (primary) + exploration-strategies (supporting)
