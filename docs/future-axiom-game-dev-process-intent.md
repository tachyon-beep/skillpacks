# Axiom/Game-Dev-Process - Intent & Design Document

**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Intent Document (Hand Off to Another Agent)
**Faction**: Axiom (Creators of Marvels - Tools, Infrastructure, Process)
**Priority**: Complementary (Build After Core Factions)

---

## Core Domain

**Game development pipeline and process** - tools, workflows, analytics, iteration methodologies.

**Focus**: The infrastructure and process that enables game development - not the game itself, but how games get made.

---

## Why Axiom?

**Axiom = Creators of Marvels = Tooling, Infrastructure, Automation**

This is meta-work (building tools to build games):
- ✅ **Development pipeline** - Build systems, asset pipelines, CI/CD
- ✅ **Process and methodology** - Agile for games, iteration frameworks
- ✅ **Analytics and measurement** - Telemetry, playtesting, data-driven design
- ✅ **Tooling** - Engines, editors, custom tools

**Not Bravos**: Bravos builds game systems, Axiom builds the pipeline
**Not Lyra**: Lyra designs experience, Axiom enables development
**Not Yzmir**: Yzmir provides theory, Axiom provides process

---

## Scope: 2 Core Packs

### Pack 1: **axiom/game-development-pipeline** (~8-10 skills)
*Production process, engines, workflow, collaboration*

### Pack 2: **axiom/playtesting-and-analytics** (~8-10 skills)
*Measuring, iterating, data-driven design*

**Total**: 2 packs, ~16-20 skills, ~40-80 hours

---

## Pack 1: axiom/game-development-pipeline (~8-10 skills)

1. **game-engine-architecture** - ECS, scene graphs, rendering pipeline, physics integration
2. **asset-pipeline-design** - Import, conversion, optimization, versioning, content addressing
3. **build-and-deployment** - CI/CD for games, platform-specific builds, automated testing
4. **version-control-for-games** - Git LFS, binary file handling, branching strategies, locks
5. **collaboration-workflow** - Designer/artist/programmer integration, conflict resolution
6. **prototyping-methodology** - Rapid iteration, throwaway code, validation before polish
7. **technical-debt-management** - Refactoring windows, architecture evolution, paying down debt
8. **live-ops-infrastructure** - Patching, hotfixes, A/B testing deployment, rollback procedures
9. **performance-profiling** - CPU/GPU profiling, memory analysis, bottleneck identification
10. **debugging-tools-and-workflow** - Debug builds, logging strategies, repro steps

---

## Pack 2: axiom/playtesting-and-analytics (~8-10 skills)

1. **playtesting-methodology** - Qualitative observation, think-alouds, structured sessions
2. **telemetry-design** - What to measure, privacy considerations, instrumentation patterns
3. **analytics-for-games** - Funnels, cohorts, retention curves, KPIs, dashboard design
4. **a-b-testing-in-games** - Experimental design, statistical significance, variant implementation
5. **qualitative-feedback-analysis** - Synthesizing player comments, sentiment analysis, themes
6. **quantitative-metrics** - Session length, retention, monetization, engagement scores
7. **user-research-methods** - Interviews, surveys, usability testing, ethnographic research
8. **iteration-frameworks** - Build-measure-learn, agile for games, sprint planning
9. **community-feedback-management** - Forums, social media, sentiment tracking, response strategies
10. **debugging-player-experience** - Why players quit, friction point identification, funnel analysis

---

## Implementation Strategy

**Build AFTER**: Core factions have some content (Bravos, Lyra, Yzmir basics)

**Reason**: Process/tooling skills make more sense once you have game design skills to apply

**Timeline**: ~40-80 hours total (realistic: 50-60 hours)

---

## Cross-Faction Integration

### References TO Axiom (Incoming)
- **Bravos** → Axiom for pipeline constraints
- **Lyra** → Axiom for UX tools
- **Yzmir** → Axiom for algorithmic optimization

### References FROM Axiom (Outgoing)
- Axiom → **All factions** (enables their work)
- Axiom → **Yzmir** for experimental design theory
- Axiom → **Muna** for documentation practices

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 2 packs built (~16-20 skills)
- ✅ Covers complete development process
- ✅ Engine-agnostic where possible
- ✅ Practical workflow patterns
- ✅ Data-driven decision frameworks

---

## Hand-Off Notes

**For agent building this**:
- Focus on process and tooling, not game content
- Engine-agnostic frameworks (Unity, Unreal, Godot, custom)
- This is meta-work (building systems to build games)
- Complements all other factions (enables their work)
