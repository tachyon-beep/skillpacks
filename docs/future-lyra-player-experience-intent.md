# Lyra/Player-Experience - Intent & Design Document

**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Intent Document (Hand Off to Another Agent)
**Faction**: Lyra (Nomadic Artists - UX, Creative, Emotional Design)
**Priority**: Complementary (Build in Parallel with Bravos)

---

## Core Domain

**Player experience and emotional engagement** - psychology, feel, polish, progression, narrative integration.

**Focus**: The subjective, creative, experiential side of games - making things feel satisfying, emotionally resonant, and engaging.

---

## Why Lyra?

**Lyra = Nomadic Artists = Creative Solutions, UX, Aesthetics**

This is experiential work:
- ✅ **Subjective feel** - "Does this feel good?"
- ✅ **Emotional design** - Creating experiences, not just mechanics
- ✅ **UX and polish** - Juice, feedback, satisfaction
- ✅ **Creative expression** - Aesthetic, artistic, narrative

**Not Bravos**: Bravos is systematic implementation, Lyra is subjective experience
**Not Yzmir**: Yzmir is theory, Lyra is applied creative work

## Implementation Strategy

**Can be built in parallel** with Bravos by different agent.

**Build order**: Any order, all self-contained.

**Timeline**: ~75-150 hours total (realistic: 90-120 hours)

---

## Cross-Faction Integration

### References TO Lyra (Incoming)
- **Bravos** → Lyra to make mechanics feel good
- **Axiom** → Lyra for UX in tools

### References FROM Lyra (Outgoing)
- Lyra → **Yzmir** for psychological theory
- Lyra → **Bravos** for mechanical implementation
- Lyra → **Muna** for communication and clarity

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 4 packs built (~30-38 skills)
- ✅ Covers complete experiential domain
- ✅ Includes ethical design throughout (not isolated)
- ✅ Can be used standalone (practical psychology)
- ✅ Complements Bravos (experience + implementation)

---

## Hand-Off Notes

**For agent building this**:
- Focus on subjective "feel" and satisfaction
- Include ethical considerations in every skill (manipulation vs motivation)
- This is the creative, artistic, UX side of game design
- Works best when paired with Bravos (mechanics) and Yzmir (theory)
