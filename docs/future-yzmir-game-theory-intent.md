# Yzmir/Game-Theory-Foundations - Intent & Design Document

**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Intent Document (Ready for Implementation)
**Faction**: Yzmir (Magicians of Mind - Theory, Algorithms, Mathematics)
**Priority**: Secondary Focus (After Yzmir AI/ML Phase 1)

---

## Core Domain

**Theoretical foundations for game design** - mathematical models, formal proofs, and deep theory explaining why game systems work.

**Focus**: The "WHY" of games - game theory, behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, optimization theory.

---

## Why Yzmir?

**Yzmir = Magicians of Mind = Theory and Mathematics**

This is theoretical work:
- ✅ **Mathematical rigor** - Formal proofs, equations, theorems
- ✅ **Algorithmic foundations** - Why algorithms work, complexity analysis
- ✅ **Deep theory** - Psychology, economics, neuroscience
- ✅ **Research-level content** - PhD-level depth when needed

**Not Bravos**: Bravos is tactical implementation ("how to build"), Yzmir is theory ("why it works")
