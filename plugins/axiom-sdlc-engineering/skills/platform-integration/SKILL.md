# Platform Integration

## Overview

This skill provides concrete implementation guidance for mapping CMMI process areas to GitHub and Azure DevOps platform features.

**Core principle**: CMMI defines WHAT processes are required. This skill shows HOW to implement them in your platform with production-ready configurations.

**Platforms covered**:
- **GitHub** - Issues, PRs, Actions, Projects for CMMI implementation
- **Azure DevOps** - Work Items, Repos, Pipelines, Boards for CMMI implementation

**Reference**: See `docs/sdlc-prescription-cmmi-levels-2-4.md` for CMMI process area definitions.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Implementing requirements traceability in GitHub/Azure DevOps
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with CMMI quality gates
- Configuring branch protection and code review policies
- Automating metrics collection for measurement
- Creating audit trails for compliance
- Migrating between platforms (GitHub ↔ Azure DevOps)
- Setting up risk tracking in work items
- Integrating CMMI processes with platform automation

**Do NOT use for**:
- CMMI process definitions → Use sdlc-prescription document
- Process-agnostic guidance → Use requirements-lifecycle, design-and-build, etc.
- Non-GitHub/Azure DevOps platforms → Adapt principles to your platform

## Platform Selection Criteria

### When to Use GitHub

**Best for**:
- Open source projects (public repositories)
- Developer-centric workflows (PRs, code review focus)
- Lightweight process (startups, small teams)
- Git-native workflows (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based)
- Strong Actions ecosystem for automation
- Integration with third-party dev tools

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Excellent developer experience
- ✅ Free for public repositories
- ✅ Strong community and marketplace
- ✅ Simple, intuitive UI
- ✅ Best-in-class code review
- ✅ Actions for flexible automation

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Limited work item hierarchy (no built-in epic → feature → story)
- ❌ Basic project management features
- ❌ Limited reporting/analytics (compared to Azure DevOps)
- ❌ No built-in test management
- ❌ Weaker audit logging (for compliance)

**CMMI Maturity**:
- **Level 2**: Fully capable
- **Level 3**: Fully capable with third-party tools
- **Level 4**: Limited (external analytics tools needed)

### When to Use Azure DevOps

**Best for**:
- Enterprise projects (regulated industries)
- Complex work item hierarchies (epic → feature → story)
- Integrated ALM (requirements → design → test → deploy)
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Microsoft stack integration (.NET, Azure)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Rich work item management
- ✅ Built-in test management
- ✅ Advanced analytics and reporting
- ✅ Audit logging for compliance
- ✅ Integrated CI/CD with environments
- ✅ Customizable processes

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ More complex to configure
- ❌ Less developer-friendly UX
- ❌ Weaker community/marketplace
- ❌ Limited free tier

**CMMI Maturity**:
- **Level 2**: Fully capable
- **Level 3**: Fully capable (native features)
- **Level 4**: Fully capable (native analytics, baselines)

### Hybrid Scenarios

**Common patterns**:
- **GitHub + Azure DevOps Boards**: Code in GitHub, work tracking in Azure DevOps
- **Azure DevOps + GitHub Actions**: Work items in Azure DevOps, CI/CD in GitHub
- **Multi-Platform**: Microservices split across platforms

**Integration options**:
- Azure Boards + GitHub integration (official)
- Zapier/Make for workflow automation
- API-based synchronization
- Third-party tools (Unito, Workato)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Treating platform as CMMI-aware** | Platforms don't enforce CMMI; you configure enforcement | Map each CMMI practice to platform feature explicitly |
| **Using platform defaults** | Defaults are permissive (no quality gates, no reviews) | Configure branch protection, required checks, policies |
| **Manual traceability** | Spreadsheet traceability becomes stale immediately | Automate with issue/PR links, work item queries, API |
| **Skipping audit trail setup** | Compliance failures discovered during audit | Configure retention, access logs, history from project start |
| **One-size-fits-all configuration** | Level 2 project gets Level 4 overhead (or vice versa) | Scale configuration based on CMMI target level |
| **Forgetting baselines** | No way to freeze requirements or code for releases | Implement baseline tagging, release branches, milestone freezes |
| **Ignoring platform limitations** | GitHub weak at test management; Azure DevOps weak at code review | Use hybrid approach or third-party tools for gaps |
| **No verification automation** | Traceability breaks without detection | Scheduled checks for orphaned requirements, missing links |
| **Generic metrics** | Collecting data nobody uses | GQM approach: Goal → Question → Metric (actionable only) |
| **Missing cross-process links** | Requirements don't link to risks; tests don't link to design | Document integration patterns in configuration |

## Integration with Other Skills

| When You're Doing | Also Use | For |
|-------------------|----------|-----|
| Platform setup for requirements | `requirements-lifecycle` | REQM/RD process definitions |
| Platform setup for CI/CD | `design-and-build` | TS/PI process definitions |
| Platform setup for testing | `quality-assurance` | VER/VAL process definitions |
| Platform setup for metrics | `quantitative-management` | MA/QPM metrics definitions |
| Platform selection decision | `governance-and-risk/dar-methodology` | Decision analysis for platform choice |
| Initial platform adoption | `lifecycle-adoption` | Incremental rollout strategy |

## Next Steps

1. **Determine your platform**: GitHub, Azure DevOps, or hybrid
2. **Identify CMMI process area**: Which process (REQM, CM, VER, etc.) are you implementing?
3. **Check target maturity level**: Level 2, 3, or 4 (from CLAUDE.md or user)
4. **Load reference sheet**: Read platform-specific implementation guide
5. **Apply configuration**: Use production-ready examples from reference sheet
6. **Verify setup**: Run verification checks for traceability, quality gates, audit trail
7. **Integrate processes**: Link requirements → code → tests → metrics

**Remember**: Platforms don't enforce CMMI compliance automatically. You must configure them to implement CMMI practices. This skill provides the configuration patterns to bridge CMMI policy to platform reality.
