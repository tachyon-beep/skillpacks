# Requirements Lifecycle

## Overview

This skill guides the complete **requirements lifecycle** from elicitation through change management. It covers both CMMI process areas:

- **RD (Requirements Development)** - Creating requirements: elicitation, analysis, specification
- **REQM (Requirements Management)** - Maintaining requirements: traceability, change control, alignment

**Key capabilities**:
- Elicit requirements from stakeholders without gold plating
- Prioritize conflicting requirements (MoSCoW, value/effort)
- Create bidirectional traceability (requirements ↔ design ↔ tests)
- Manage requirements volatility with impact analysis
- Scale practices from Level 2 (user stories) → Level 3 (templates) → Level 4 (metrics)

**Reference**: See `docs/sdlc-prescription-cmmi-levels-2-4.md` Section 3.1 (Requirements Phase) for complete CMMI policy.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Requirements changing constantly** - Stakeholder keeps revising, need volatility management
- **Scope creep pressure** - "Just one more thing" additions, need change control
- **Traceability needed** - Level 3 compliance, audit preparation, creating RTM
- **Stakeholder conflicts** - Competing requirements from VPs, need resolution process
- **Documentation overhead concerns** - "How much is enough?" for Level 2 vs. Level 3
- **Creating new features** - Starting requirements gathering for major work
- **Audit preparation** - Need to establish requirements baseline and traceability

## High-Level Guidance

### RD vs. REQM: Two Process Areas, One Lifecycle

**Requirements Development (RD)** = Creating new requirements
- Elicit needs from stakeholders (interviews, workshops)
- Analyze and prioritize (MoSCoW, value/effort)
- Specify with acceptance criteria (user stories, formal specs)
- Validate with stakeholders

**Requirements Management (REQM)** = Maintaining existing requirements
- Maintain bidirectional traceability (req ↔ design ↔ tests)
- Manage changes (change requests, impact analysis, approval)
- Ensure alignment (work products match requirements)
- Communicate changes to affected parties

**Timeline**: RD happens during requirements phase. REQM is **continuous** throughout the project.

**Common mistake**: Treating them as sequential. They're concurrent - you develop new requirements while managing existing ones.

### Bidirectional Traceability: Free vs. Theater

**The Modern Approach** (Recommended):

Traceability as **workflow byproduct** using platform-native linking:

```
GitHub:
- Commit message: "Implements #123" → auto-links to requirement
- PR description: "Closes #123" → auto-links to requirement
- Test file comment: "Verifies #123" → searchable reference
- Generate RTM on-demand via API query (for audits)

Azure DevOps:
- Commit message: "AB#123" → auto-links to work item
- Built-in traceability views (work item → commits → builds)
- Query for RTM when needed
```

**Key principle**: Traceability should be **free** (part of normal workflow), not a separate manual task.

**Anti-Pattern**: Manual spreadsheet RTM that becomes stale within days.

**Level 2**: Platform linking is sufficient (GitHub Issues ↔ PRs ↔ commits)
**Level 3**: Tool-based queries to generate traceability reports
**Level 4**: Automated coverage metrics (% requirements traced, orphaned tests detected)

See `requirements-traceability.md` for GitHub/Azure DevOps implementation patterns.

### Change Impact Analysis: Template vs. Ad-Hoc

**Baseline agents said**: "Perform impact analysis" (but didn't say HOW).

**This skill provides**: Impact analysis **checklist** and **template**.

**Minimal Impact Analysis** (Level 2):
```
Change Request: Add OAuth login support
Affected Requirements: REQ-AUTH-001, REQ-AUTH-002
Impact:
  - Design: New OAuth module needed
  - Implementation: 3 days effort
  - Testing: 5 new test cases (2 days)
  - Documentation: User guide update (1 day)
  Total Effort: 6 days
  Schedule Impact: Delays Sprint 3 → Sprint 4
Approval: Product Owner (required)
```

**Formal Impact Analysis** (Level 3):
- Uses structured template (see `requirements-change-management.md`)
- Multiple approval authorities (Product Owner + Tech Lead + QA Lead)
- Traceability verification (all downstream artifacts identified)
- Risk assessment (technical, schedule, budget risks)

**Quantitative Impact Analysis** (Level 4):
- Historical data: "Similar changes averaged 8 days ± 2 days"
- Volatility impact: "Adding this increases monthly change rate from 12% → 18%"
- Predictive: "This puts us 1σ above baseline, likely to slip milestone"

See `requirements-change-management.md` for complete templates and workflows.

### Preventing Gold Plating and Scope Creep

**Two enforcement mechanisms**:

**1. MoSCoW Prioritization**

Classify every requirement:
- **Must Have** - Non-negotiable, project fails without it
- **Should Have** - Important but not critical, could defer 1 sprint
- **Could Have** - Nice to have, include if capacity available
- **Won't Have** - Out of scope, explicitly deferred

**Enforcement**: Once sprint capacity is reached (e.g., 30 story points), all new additions must be "Could Have" or "Won't Have". Product Owner can't add "Must Have" mid-sprint without removing existing "Must Have".

**2. Change Request Process**

Level 2: Lightweight - Product Owner approval, informal impact assessment
Level 3: Formal - Change request form, multi-party approval, documented impact
Level 4: Quantitative - Change metrics tracked, volatility thresholds enforced

**Red flag**: >30% requirements changed per sprint → Scope thrashing, need stakeholder stabilization meeting.

See `requirements-analysis.md` for prioritization templates and conflict resolution.

### Level 2 vs. 3 vs. 4: What Changes?

**Biggest misconception**: Level 3 requires 100-page specs and waterfall.

**Reality**:

| Aspect | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Format** | User stories + acceptance criteria | Organizational template | + Quality metrics |
| **Review** | Optional/informal | Peer review required | + Defect density tracking |
| **Traceability** | Spreadsheet OR platform links | Tool-based, API-generated | + Coverage metrics (>95%) |
| **Changes** | Tracked in issue history | Formal change requests, approval workflow | + Volatility metrics, SPC |
| **Effort** | 3-5% project time | 10-15% project time | 15-20% project time |

**Escalation from L2 → L3**:
- Audit/compliance requirement
- Team size >10 developers
- Regulatory industry (medical, financial, aerospace)
- Requirements volatility causing quality issues

**Escalation from L3 → L4**:
- Need quantitative quality objectives
- Safety-critical system requiring statistical control
- Process improvement requires data-driven decisions

See `level-scaling.md` for complete escalation criteria and de-escalation guidance.

### Quick Start by Scenario

**Scenario 1: New Feature, Starting from Scratch**

1. Load `requirements-elicitation.md` - Run stakeholder workshop
2. Load `requirements-specification.md` - Document as user stories (L2) or template (L3)
3. Load `requirements-traceability.md` - Set up GitHub/Azure DevOps linking
4. Begin implementation - REQM now kicks in (continuous change management)

**Timeline**: 1-2 days for Level 2, 3-5 days for Level 3

**Scenario 2: Constant Changes, Volatility Management**

1. Load `requirements-change-management.md` - Implement change request process
2. Calculate current volatility rate: (Added + Modified + Deleted) / Total per sprint
3. If >30% → Stakeholder stabilization meeting required
4. Set threshold: Level 2 (<30%), Level 3 (<20%), Level 4 (<10%)
5. Track metrics, escalate if threshold exceeded

**Scenario 3: Stakeholder Conflict, Two VPs Want Different Things**

1. Load `requirements-analysis.md` - Conflict resolution section
2. Document both requirements objectively (no advocacy)
3. Create decision criteria matrix (business value, risk, ROI)
4. Escalate to decision authority (both VPs' common manager)
5. Cross-reference to `governance-and-risk` skill for ADR process

**Do NOT**: Make the business decision yourself, pick sides, or implement both hoping it works out.

**Scenario 4: Audit Preparation, Need RTM**

1. Load `requirements-traceability.md` - GitHub/Azure DevOps RTM patterns
2. If using GitHub: Use Projects with custom fields OR API-generated report
3. If using Azure DevOps: Use built-in traceability views
4. Verify bidirectional coverage: Requirements → Tests AND Tests → Requirements
5. Address orphaned tests (tests not linked to requirements)

**Target**: >90% coverage for Level 3, >95% for Level 4

**Scenario 5: "How much documentation?" Question**

1. Load `level-scaling.md` - Shows exactly what Level 2/3/4 require
2. Level 2 answer: User stories + acceptance criteria (2-4 pages per sprint)
3. Overhead: 3-5% project time
4. Common fear: "We'll spend all our time writing specs" → Reality: 1-2 hours per sprint
