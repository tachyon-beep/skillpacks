## Core Concepts

### Boids Algorithm (Reynolds 1987)

**What**: Three simple rules create emergent flocking behavior. Industry standard for crowd simulation.

**The Three Rules**:

1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors (steer away from nearby agents)
2. **Alignment**: Steer toward average heading of neighbors
3. **Cohesion**: Steer toward center of mass of neighbors

```python
class Boid:
    def __init__(self, position, velocity):
        self.position = position  # Vector2
        self.velocity = velocity  # Vector2
        self.max_speed = 2.0
        self.max_force = 0.5

        # Boids parameters
        self.separation_radius = 1.5  # meters
        self.alignment_radius = 3.0
        self.cohesion_radius = 3.0

        self.separation_weight = 1.5
        self.alignment_weight = 1.0
        self.cohesion_weight = 1.0

    def update(self, neighbors, dt):
        """Update boid using three rules"""
        # Calculate steering forces
        separation_force = self.calculate_separation(neighbors)
        alignment_force = self.calculate_alignment(neighbors)
        cohesion_force = self.calculate_cohesion(neighbors)

        # Weight and combine forces
        acceleration = (
            separation_force * self.separation_weight +
            alignment_force * self.alignment_weight +
            cohesion_force * self.cohesion_weight
        )

        # Update velocity and position
        self.velocity += acceleration * dt
        self.velocity = self.velocity.limit(self.max_speed)
        self.position += self.velocity * dt

    def calculate_separation(self, neighbors):
        """Rule 1: Steer away from nearby agents"""
        steering = Vector2(0, 0)
        count = 0

        for other in neighbors:
            distance = (self.position - other.position).length()

            if 0 < distance < self.separation_radius:
                # Create avoidance force (stronger when closer)
                diff = self.position - other.position
                diff = diff.normalized() / distance  # Weight by inverse distance
                steering += diff
                count += 1

        if count > 0:
            steering /= count

            # Steering = desired - current
            steering = steering.normalized() * self.max_speed
            steering -= self.velocity
            steering = steering.limit(self.max_force)

        return steering

    def calculate_alignment(self, neighbors):
        """Rule 2: Match velocity with neighbors"""
        average_velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
        count = 0

        for other in neighbors:
            distance = (self.position - other.position).length()

            if 0 < distance < self.alignment_radius:
                average_velocity += other.velocity
                count += 1

        if count > 0:
            average_velocity /= count
            average_velocity = average_velocity.normalized() * self.max_speed

            steering = average_velocity - self.velocity
            steering = steering.limit(self.max_force)
            return steering

        return Vector2(0, 0)

    def calculate_cohesion(self, neighbors):
        """Rule 3: Steer toward center of mass of neighbors"""
        center_of_mass = Vector2(0, 0)
        count = 0

        for other in neighbors:
            distance = (self.position - other.position).length()

            if 0 < distance < self.cohesion_radius:
                center_of_mass += other.position
                count += 1

        if count > 0:
            center_of_mass /= count

            # Steer toward center
            desired = center_of_mass - self.position
            desired = desired.normalized() * self.max_speed

            steering = desired - self.velocity
            steering = steering.limit(self.max_force)
            return steering

        return Vector2(0, 0)
```

**Why Boids Works**:
- **Local rules → Global behavior**: No central coordination needed
- **Emergent patterns**: Flocks, streams, avoidance emerge naturally
- **Computationally cheap**: Only uses neighbor positions/velocities
- **Scalable**: Each agent only considers neighbors, not entire crowd

**Tuning Boids Parameters**:

| Parameter | Low Value | High Value | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Separation weight | Agents touch | Agents stay apart | Panicked crowd (low), orderly queue (high) |
| Alignment weight | Chaotic directions | Uniform flow | Individuals (low), marching band (high) |
| Cohesion weight | Agents disperse | Tight clusters | Strangers (low), families (high) |
| Neighbor radius | Only closest agents | Large perception | Dense crowd (small), open field (large) |

**Real-World Example**: *Batman: Arkham Knight* uses Boids for crowd panic scenes with 300+ civilians fleeing.

### Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO)

**What**: Predictive collision avoidance. Each agent selects velocity that avoids future collisions, not just current ones.

**Problem with Naive Collision**: Agents react AFTER collision starts, causing bouncing and overlap.

**RVO Solution**: Calculate "velocity obstacles" - velocities that would cause collision in next N seconds. Avoid those velocities.

```python
import math

class RVOAgent:
    def __init__(self, position, radius=0.4):
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
        self.radius = radius
        self.max_speed = 1.5
        self.preferred_velocity = Vector2(0, 0)  # Where agent wants to go

        # RVO parameters
        self.time_horizon = 2.0  # Look ahead 2 seconds
        self.neighbor_distance = 10.0

    def compute_new_velocity(self, neighbors):
        """Compute collision-free velocity using RVO"""
        # Start with preferred velocity (toward goal)
        new_velocity = self.preferred_velocity

        # For each neighbor, compute velocity obstacle
        for other in neighbors:
            if other == self:
                continue

            distance = (other.position - self.position).length()
            if distance > self.neighbor_distance:
                continue

            # Calculate velocity obstacle (cone of velocities that cause collision)
            vo_apex = self.position
            relative_pos = other.position - self.position
            relative_vel = self.velocity - other.velocity

            # Combined radius
            combined_radius = self.radius + other.radius

            # If currently colliding, separate immediately
            if distance < combined_radius:
                # Emergency separation
                separation = (self.position - other.position).normalized()
                new_velocity += separation * self.max_speed
                continue

            # Calculate velocity obstacle boundary
            # (Simplified version - full RVO is more complex)
            cutoff_center = relative_pos / self.time_horizon

            # Check if preferred velocity is inside velocity obstacle
            if self._is_inside_vo(new_velocity, cutoff_center, combined_radius, distance):
                # Find closest velocity outside VO
                new_velocity = self._find_safe_velocity(
                    new_velocity,
                    cutoff_center,
                    combined_radius,
                    distance
                )

        return new_velocity.limit(self.max_speed)

    def _is_inside_vo(self, velocity, vo_center, radius, distance):
        """Check if velocity leads to collision"""
        relative_vel = velocity - vo_center

        # Check if velocity is in collision cone
        distance_sq = relative_vel.length_squared()
        collision_threshold = (radius / distance) ** 2

        return distance_sq < collision_threshold

    def _find_safe_velocity(self, preferred, vo_center, radius, distance):
        """Find velocity outside velocity obstacle closest to preferred"""
        # Simplified: Move perpendicular to collision direction
        to_obstacle = vo_center.normalized()
        perpendicular = Vector2(-to_obstacle.y, to_obstacle.x)

        # Try both perpendicular directions
        option1 = to_obstacle * (self.max_speed * 0.5) + perpendicular * self.max_speed
        option2 = to_obstacle * (self.max_speed * 0.5) - perpendicular * self.max_speed

        # Pick closest to preferred velocity
        if (option1 - preferred).length() < (option2 - preferred).length():
            return option1
        else:
            return option2
```

**RVO vs Boids Separation**:

| Aspect | Boids Separation | RVO |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| Timing | Reactive (avoid current collision) | Predictive (avoid future collision) |
| Computation | Simple distance checks | Velocity obstacle calculation |
| Quality | Agents can overlap briefly | Smooth collision-free movement |
| Cost | Very cheap | Moderate cost |
| Use Case | Large crowds (1000+) | Hero agents, visible crowds |

**When to Use Each**:
- **Boids**: Dense crowds where slight overlap is acceptable (protests, stadiums)
- **RVO**: Important agents where collision-free is critical (hero NPCs, cutscenes)
- **Hybrid**: RVO for nearby agents (< 20m), Boids for distant (> 20m) - LOD approach

**Real-World Example**: *Unity's NavMesh Obstacle Avoidance* uses RVO variant for collision-free agent movement.

### Social Forces Model (Helbing)

**What**: Psychological forces in addition to physical collision. People avoid each other BEFORE touching.

**Concept**: Agents have "personal space" they defend. Getting too close creates repulsive force.

```python
class SocialForceAgent:
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
        self.goal = None

        # Social forces parameters
        self.desired_speed = 1.34  # Average human walking speed (m/s)
        self.personal_space = 0.8  # meters (comfort zone)
        self.mass = 80  # kg

        # Force weights
        self.goal_force_weight = 2.0
        self.social_force_weight = 2.1
        self.obstacle_force_weight = 10.0

        # Relaxation time (how quickly agent adjusts velocity toward desired)
        self.tau = 0.5  # seconds

    def compute_forces(self, neighbors, obstacles):
        """Calculate all forces acting on agent"""
        # Force 1: Goal attraction (where agent wants to go)
        goal_force = self.calculate_goal_force()

        # Force 2: Social repulsion (avoid other agents)
        social_force = self.calculate_social_force(neighbors)

        # Force 3: Obstacle repulsion (avoid walls)
        obstacle_force = self.calculate_obstacle_force(obstacles)

        # Total force
        total_force = (
            goal_force * self.goal_force_weight +
            social_force * self.social_force_weight +
            obstacle_force * self.obstacle_force_weight
        )

        return total_force

    def calculate_goal_force(self):
        """Force pulling agent toward goal"""
        if self.goal is None:
            return Vector2(0, 0)

        # Desired velocity (direction to goal at desired speed)
        direction = (self.goal - self.position).normalized()
        desired_velocity = direction * self.desired_speed

        # Force to adjust current velocity toward desired
        # F = m * (v_desired - v_current) / tau
        force = self.mass * (desired_velocity - self.velocity) / self.tau

        return force

    def calculate_social_force(self, neighbors):
        """Repulsive force from nearby agents"""
        total_force = Vector2(0, 0)

        for other in neighbors:
            # Vector from other to self
            relative_pos = self.position - other.position
            distance = relative_pos.length()

            if distance < 0.01:
                distance = 0.01  # Avoid division by zero

            # Exponential decay with distance
            # Closer agents = stronger repulsion
            A = 2.1  # Interaction strength
            B = 0.3  # Interaction range

            magnitude = A * math.exp((self.personal_space - distance) / B)
            direction = relative_pos.normalized()

            force = direction * magnitude
            total_force += force

        return total_force

    def calculate_obstacle_force(self, obstacles):
        """Repulsive force from walls/obstacles"""
        total_force = Vector2(0, 0)

        for obstacle in obstacles:
            # Find closest point on obstacle to agent
            closest_point = obstacle.closest_point(self.position)

            relative_pos = self.position - closest_point
            distance = relative_pos.length()

            if distance < 0.01:
                distance = 0.01

            # Stronger repulsion than social force
            A = 10.0
            B = 0.2

            magnitude = A * math.exp(-distance / B)
            direction = relative_pos.normalized()

            force = direction * magnitude
            total_force += force

        return total_force

    def update(self, neighbors, obstacles, dt):
        """Update agent using social forces"""
        forces = self.compute_forces(neighbors, obstacles)

        # F = ma, so a = F/m
        acceleration = forces / self.mass

        # Update velocity and position
        self.velocity += acceleration * dt

        # Limit speed
        speed = self.velocity.length()
        if speed > self.desired_speed * 1.3:  # Allow 30% over desired
            self.velocity = self.velocity.normalized() * (self.desired_speed * 1.3)

        self.position += self.velocity * dt
```

**Social Forces vs Boids**:

| Aspect | Boids | Social Forces |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Origin | Biological (birds, fish) | Psychological (humans) |
| Personal space | No explicit concept | Explicit personal space radius |
| Goal-seeking | Added separately | Built into model |
| Calibration | Easier to tune | More parameters, harder to tune |
| Realism | Good for animals | Better for humans |

**When to Use Social Forces**:
- Human crowds (not animals/aliens)
- Evacuation simulations (real-world validation needed)
- High-density crowds (subway, concerts)
- When psychological realism matters

**Real-World Example**: *Crowd simulation for stadium evacuations* uses Social Forces for safety analysis.

### Spatial Partitioning for O(1) Neighbor Queries

**Problem**: Finding neighbors is O(n). With 1000 agents, each neighbor query searches 1000 agents.

**Solution**: Spatial hash grid. Divide space into cells, each agent only checks its cell + adjacent cells.

```python
class SpatialHashGrid:
    def __init__(self, cell_size=2.0):
        self.cell_size = cell_size  # meters
        self.grid = {}  # {(cell_x, cell_y): [agents in cell]}

    def clear(self):
        """Clear all cells (call once per frame before rebuild)"""
        self.grid.clear()

    def get_cell(self, position):
        """Get cell coordinates for position"""
        cell_x = int(position.x / self.cell_size)
        cell_y = int(position.y / self.cell_size)
        return (cell_x, cell_y)

    def insert(self, agent):
        """Insert agent into grid"""
        cell = self.get_cell(agent.position)

        if cell not in self.grid:
            self.grid[cell] = []

        self.grid[cell].append(agent)

    def query_neighbors(self, position, radius):
        """Get all agents within radius of position"""
        # Determine which cells to check
        min_x = int((position.x - radius) / self.cell_size)
        max_x = int((position.x + radius) / self.cell_size)
        min_y = int((position.y - radius) / self.cell_size)
        max_y = int((position.y + radius) / self.cell_size)

        neighbors = []

        # Check all cells in range
        for cx in range(min_x, max_x + 1):
            for cy in range(min_y, max_y + 1):
                cell = (cx, cy)

                if cell in self.grid:
                    # Check each agent in cell
                    for agent in self.grid[cell]:
                        distance = (agent.position - position).length()
                        if distance <= radius:
                            neighbors.append(agent)

        return neighbors


# Usage in crowd simulation
class CrowdSimulation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
        self.spatial_grid = SpatialHashGrid(cell_size=3.0)

    def update(self, dt):
        # STEP 1: Rebuild spatial grid
        self.spatial_grid.clear()
        for agent in self.agents:
            self.spatial_grid.insert(agent)

        # STEP 2: Update each agent using spatial queries
        for agent in self.agents:
            # Get neighbors (FAST - only checks nearby cells)
            neighbors = self.spatial_grid.query_neighbors(
                agent.position,
                radius=5.0
            )

            # Update agent with neighbors
            agent.update(neighbors, dt)
```

**Performance Comparison**:

```
Naive neighbor search (no spatial structure):
- 1000 agents, each searches 1000 = 1,000,000 checks per frame
- At 60 FPS = 60,000,000 checks per second
- Cost: O(n²)

Spatial hash grid:
- 1000 agents, each searches ~9 cells × ~10 agents = ~90 checks per frame
- At 60 FPS = 5,400,000 checks per second
- Cost: O(n) - linear, not quadratic
- Speedup: 11× faster (in practice, 10-50× depending on density)
```

**Cell Size Tuning**:
- **Too small**: Many cells, more cells to check per query
- **Too large**: Many agents per cell, back to O(n) within cell
- **Rule of thumb**: Cell size = 2 × neighbor query radius
- **Example**: If agents check 3m radius, use 6m cell size

**Alternative Spatial Structures**:

| Structure | Query Cost | Insert Cost | Best For |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Spatial hash grid | O(1) avg | O(1) | Uniform density, dynamic |
| Quadtree | O(log n) | O(log n) | Non-uniform density |
| BVH | O(log n) | O(n log n) | Static obstacles |
| kd-tree | O(log n) | O(n log n) | Static agents |

**Use spatial hash for crowd simulation** - best balance of speed and simplicity for dynamic agents.

**Real-World Example**: *Unity's ECS* uses spatial hash for entity queries in Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS).

### Level-of-Detail (LOD) Systems

**Problem**: All 1000 agents run full simulation even when 900 are off-screen or distant.

**Solution**: LOD hierarchy - distant agents use simpler simulation.

#### Visual LOD (Rendering)

```python
class CrowdRenderer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Three mesh levels
        self.high_detail_mesh = load_mesh("agent_high.obj")  # 5000 tris
        self.medium_detail_mesh = load_mesh("agent_med.obj")  # 1000 tris
        self.low_detail_mesh = load_mesh("agent_low.obj")    # 200 tris
        self.impostor_sprite = load_texture("agent_sprite.png")  # Billboard

        # Distance thresholds
        self.high_lod_distance = 20.0   # meters
        self.medium_lod_distance = 50.0
        self.low_lod_distance = 100.0

    def render(self, agent, camera_position):
        """Render agent with LOD based on distance"""
        distance = (agent.position - camera_position).length()

        if distance < self.high_lod_distance:
            # Close: Full detail mesh + skeleton + cloth sim
            render_mesh(agent, self.high_detail_mesh)
            update_skeleton(agent)
            simulate_cloth(agent)

        elif distance < self.medium_lod_distance:
            # Medium: Simplified mesh + skeleton, no cloth
            render_mesh(agent, self.medium_detail_mesh)
            update_skeleton(agent)

        elif distance < self.low_lod_distance:
            # Far: Low-poly mesh, no skeleton (baked animations)
            render_mesh(agent, self.low_detail_mesh)

        else:
            # Very far: Billboard sprite
            render_impostor(agent, self.impostor_sprite, camera_position)
```

#### Behavior LOD (Simulation)

```python
class LODCrowdSimulation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []

        # LOD distance thresholds
        self.lod0_distance = 30.0   # Full simulation
        self.lod1_distance = 100.0  # Simplified simulation

    def update(self, dt, camera_position):
        for agent in self.agents:
            distance = (agent.position - camera_position).length()

            if distance < self.lod0_distance:
                # LOD 0: Full simulation
                # - Full Boids (separation, alignment, cohesion)
                # - RVO collision avoidance
                # - Individual pathfinding
                # - Social forces
                agent.update_full(dt)

            elif distance < self.lod1_distance:
                # LOD 1: Simplified simulation (30 Hz instead of 60 Hz)
                if frame_count % 2 == 0:  # Every other frame
                    # - Basic Boids (separation only)
                    # - No RVO (use simple repulsion)
                    # - Flow field instead of pathfinding
                    agent.update_simple(dt * 2)  # Double dt to compensate

            elif distance < self.lod2_distance:
                # LOD 2: Very simplified (10 Hz)

                # Agent moves on rails or doesn't move at all
                pass  # No update
```

**LOD Performance Impact**:

```
Without LOD (1000 agents):
- All agents: Full simulation at 60 Hz
- CPU time: ~50ms per frame (unplayable)

With LOD (1000 agents, camera in crowd):
- 50 agents in LOD 0 (< 30m): Full simulation at 60 Hz → 2.5ms
- 200 agents in LOD 1 (30-100m): Simple simulation at 30 Hz → 3.3ms
- 400 agents in LOD 2 (100-200m): Minimal simulation at 10 Hz → 2.2ms
- 350 agents in LOD 3 (> 200m): No simulation → 0ms
- Total CPU time: ~8ms per frame (playable at 60 FPS!)

Speedup: 6× faster
```

**LOD Best Practices**:
1. **Hysteresis**: Add buffer to distance thresholds to prevent LOD thrashing
   ```python
   # Transition from LOD 0 → LOD 1 at 30m
   # Transition from LOD 1 → LOD 0 at 25m (5m buffer)
   ```
2. **Budget-based LOD**: Limit number of high-LOD agents regardless of distance
3. **Visibility-based**: Off-screen agents always low LOD even if close
4. **Smooth transitions**: Blend between LOD levels over 1-2 seconds

**Real-World Example**: *Assassin's Creed Unity* renders 10,000+ NPCs using 5-level LOD system (high detail, medium, low, impostor, culled).

### Formation Patterns

**Problem**: Groups of agents (families, squads) should stay together in cohesive shape.

**Solution**: Formation system with leader-follower and slot assignment.

```python
class Formation:
    def __init__(self, formation_type="line"):
        self.leader = None
        self.followers = []
        self.formation_type = formation_type

                slot_pos = self.leader.position + Vector2(
                    math.cos(angle) * radius,
                    math.sin(angle) * radius
                )

```

**Formation Types and Use Cases**:

| Formation | Shape | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Line | `X X X X` | Families walking side-by-side |
| Column | `X X X X` (vertical) | Marching, narrow paths |
| Wedge | `X X X X X` (V-shape) | Military squads, aggressive movement |
| Circle | `X X X` (around leader) | Defensive, crowd around celebrity |
| Scatter | Random offsets | Casual groups, tourists |

**Formation Breaking**:
- Followers too far from slot → Break formation, catch up
- Leader stops → Followers gather around
- Obstacle blocks slot → Follower temporarily leaves formation
- Leader changes direction rapidly → Formation reforms with delay

**Real-World Example**: *Total War* games use formations for thousands of soldiers in regiments with tight cohesion.

## Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Individual Agents vs Flow Fields

**Question**: Should I simulate each agent individually or use flow fields?

```
START: How many agents moving to SAME destination?

├─ < 50 agents
│  └─ Use INDIVIDUAL PATHFINDING (A*, NavMesh)
│     - Each agent has unique path
│     - Full steering behaviors
│     - Collision avoidance per agent
│
├─ 50-200 agents to SAME goal
│  └─ Use HYBRID
│     - Flow field for general direction
│     - Individual steering for local avoidance
│     - Best of both worlds
│
└─ 200+ agents to SAME goal
   └─ Use FLOW FIELDS
      - Pre-compute direction field to goal
      - All agents follow field (O(1) per agent)
      - Add randomness to prevent uniformity
```

**Flow Field Implementation**:

```python
class FlowField:
    def __init__(self, grid_size, cell_size):
        self.grid_size = grid_size  # e.g., 100x100
        self.cell_size = cell_size  # e.g., 2 meters
        self.direction_field = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size, 2))  # Direction vectors

    def generate_from_goal(self, goal_position, obstacles):
        """Generate flow field pointing toward goal using Dijkstra"""
        # Step 1: Initialize cost field (distance to goal)
        cost_field = np.full((self.grid_size, self.grid_size), np.inf)

        # Goal cell has cost 0
        goal_cell = self.world_to_cell(goal_position)
        cost_field[goal_cell] = 0

        # Step 2: Propagate costs (Dijkstra from goal)
        open_set = [goal_cell]

        while open_set:
            current = open_set.pop(0)
            current_cost = cost_field[current]

            # Check neighbors
            for neighbor in self.get_neighbors(current):
                if self.is_obstacle(neighbor, obstacles):
                    continue

                new_cost = current_cost + 1  # Uniform cost

                if new_cost < cost_field[neighbor]:
                    cost_field[neighbor] = new_cost
                    open_set.append(neighbor)

        # Step 3: Generate direction field (downhill in cost field)
        for x in range(self.grid_size):
            for y in range(self.grid_size):
                if cost_field[x, y] == np.inf:
                    continue  # Unreachable

                # Find neighbor with lowest cost
                best_neighbor = None
                best_cost = cost_field[x, y]

                for nx, ny in self.get_neighbors((x, y)):
                    if cost_field[nx, ny] < best_cost:
                        best_cost = cost_field[nx, ny]
                        best_neighbor = (nx, ny)

                if best_neighbor:
                    # Direction points to best neighbor
                    direction = Vector2(
                        best_neighbor[0] - x,
                        best_neighbor[1] - y
                    ).normalized()
                    self.direction_field[x, y] = [direction.x, direction.y]

    def get_direction(self, world_position):
        """Get flow direction at world position"""
        cell = self.world_to_cell(world_position)

        if self.is_valid_cell(cell):
            dir_x, dir_y = self.direction_field[cell]
            return Vector2(dir_x, dir_y)

        return Vector2(0, 0)


# Agent using flow field
class FlowFieldAgent:
    def update(self, flow_field, dt):
        # Get direction from flow field
        flow_direction = flow_field.get_direction(self.position)

        # Follow flow with some randomness
        random_offset = Vector2(
            random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2),
            random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2)
        )

        desired_velocity = (flow_direction + random_offset).normalized() * self.speed

        # Still need local collision avoidance
        neighbors = get_nearby(self.position, radius=2.0)
        separation = calculate_separation(self, neighbors)

        # Combine flow following (80%) and separation (20%)
        self.velocity = desired_velocity * 0.8 + separation * 0.2
        self.position += self.velocity * dt
```

**Performance Comparison**:

```
500 agents going to same exit:

Individual A*:
- 500 agents × 1ms pathfinding = 500ms per frame
- Result: 2 FPS (unplayable)

Flow Field:
- Generate field once: 10ms (one-time cost)
- 500 agents × 0.01ms follow field = 5ms per frame
- Result: 60 FPS (playable!)

Speedup: 100× faster
```

**When Flow Fields Fail**:
- Agents have DIFFERENT destinations → Need individual paths
- Complex multi-level geometry → Flow field doesn't handle 3D well
- Small number of agents (< 50) → Overhead of generating field not worth it

---

### Framework 2: When Does LOD Become Mandatory?

**Question**: At what crowd size do I MUST implement LOD?

```
Agent count thresholds:

├─ < 50 agents
│  └─ LOD OPTIONAL
│     - Can run full simulation at 60 FPS
│     - LOD adds complexity, may not be worth it
│     - Exception: If agents have expensive AI (GOAP, complex pathfinding)
│
├─ 50-200 agents
│  └─ VISUAL LOD RECOMMENDED
│     - Rendering becomes bottleneck
│     - Use mesh LOD (high/medium/low poly)
│     - Behavior LOD still optional
│
├─ 200-1000 agents
│  └─ BEHAVIOR + VISUAL LOD REQUIRED
│     - Simulation becomes bottleneck
│     - Use frequency reduction (60 Hz → 30 Hz → 10 Hz)
│     - Use simplified algorithms (Boids only, no RVO)
│
└─ 1000+ agents
   └─ AGGRESSIVE LOD + GPU REQUIRED
      - Multi-level behavior LOD (4+ levels)
      - GPU rendering (instancing, compute shaders)
      - Consider GPU simulation (compute shaders)
```

**LOD Budget Example**:

```
Target: 1000 agents at 60 FPS
Frame budget: 16.67ms
Simulation budget: 8ms (50% of frame)

Without LOD:
- 1000 agents × 0.05ms = 50ms per frame
- Result: FAIL (need 8ms, have 50ms)

With 3-level LOD:
- LOD 0 (50 agents, < 30m): Full sim at 60 Hz = 2.5ms
- LOD 1 (200 agents, 30-100m): Simple sim at 30 Hz = 3.3ms
- LOD 2 (400 agents, 100-200m): Minimal sim at 10 Hz = 2.2ms
- LOD 3 (350 agents, > 200m): No sim = 0ms
- Total: 8ms per frame
- Result: SUCCESS (within budget)
```

**Rule of Thumb**:
- **50 agents**: No LOD needed
- **100 agents**: Visual LOD recommended
- **200 agents**: Behavior LOD required
- **500+ agents**: Multi-level LOD required
- **1000+ agents**: GPU simulation consideration

---

### Framework 3: Realistic vs Stylized Crowd Behavior

**Question**: How realistic should crowd behavior be?

```
Determine realism level based on:

├─ SIMULATION PURPOSE
│  ├─ Safety analysis (stadium evacuation) → MAXIMUM realism
│  ├─ Game background (city streets) → MODERATE realism
│  └─ Arcade game (zombie horde) → STYLIZED, not realistic
│
├─ PLAYER INTERACTION
│  ├─ Player watches closely → HIGH realism needed
│  ├─ Player occasionally looks → MODERATE realism
│  └─ Background only → LOW realism sufficient
│
└─ PERFORMANCE BUDGET
   ├─ High budget (< 500 agents) → Can afford realism
   └─ Low budget (1000+ agents) → Must simplify
```

**Realism Spectrum**:

| Level | Characteristics | Techniques | Use Case |
|-------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Maximum Realism** | Validated against real crowds | Social forces, RVO, personality variation, dynamic speeds | Safety simulations |
| **High Realism** | Looks believable to player | Boids + RVO, formations, some personality | AAA game crowds |
| **Moderate Realism** | Looks okay if not scrutinized | Boids only, no RVO, uniform agents | City builder background |
| **Low Realism (Stylized)** | Acceptable for genre | Flow fields, no collision (some overlap okay) | RTS unit swarms |
| **Fake** | Illusion of crowd | Scripted movement, looping animations | Very distant background |

**Tuning for Realism**:

```python
# Realistic human crowd (parade, evacuation)
class RealisticCrowdConfig:
    # Speed variation (not all same speed)
    speed_mean = 1.34  # m/s (average human walking)
    speed_stddev = 0.2  # ±0.2 m/s variation

    # Personal space (people avoid before touching)
    personal_space = 0.8  # meters
    comfortable_density = 2.0  # people per square meter
    max_density = 5.5  # crushes above this (dangerous!)

    # Reaction time (not instant)
    reaction_time_mean = 0.4  # seconds
    reaction_time_stddev = 0.1

    # Anticipation (look ahead)
    anticipation_distance = 3.0  # meters

    # Group behavior (70% of people in groups)
    group_probability = 0.7
    group_size_mean = 3  # Average family size

    # Elderly/children slower
    child_speed_multiplier = 0.7
    elderly_speed_multiplier = 0.6


# Stylized game crowd (zombies, swarm)
class StylizedCrowdConfig:
    # Uniform speed (all identical)
    speed = 2.0  # m/s (faster than humans)

    # No personal space (can overlap slightly)
    personal_space = 0.0
    comfortable_density = 10.0  # Densely packed

    # Instant reaction (video game feel)
    reaction_time = 0.0

    # No anticipation (reactive only)
    anticipation_distance = 0.0

    # No groups (all individuals)
    group_probability = 0.0
```

**Believability vs Performance**:
- **80/20 rule**: Get 80% believability with 20% of effort
- **Good enough threshold**: If playtesters don't notice issues, stop
- **Don't over-optimize**: Distant crowds can be very simple without hurting experience

---

### Framework 4: Collision Strategy Selection

**Question**: Which collision avoidance should I use?

```
Choose based on agent importance and density:

├─ HERO AGENTS (player companions, boss enemies)
│  └─ Use RVO (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles)
│     - Collision-free movement
│     - Smooth paths
│     - Higher CPU cost justified
│
├─ VISIBLE AGENTS (near camera, < 50 agents)
│  └─ Use BOIDS + SOCIAL FORCES
│     - Psychological avoidance
│     - Good enough quality
│     - Moderate CPU cost
│
├─ DENSE CROWDS (> 100 agents/m², protests, stadiums)
│  └─ Use BOIDS SEPARATION ONLY
│     - Simple distance-based repulsion
│     - Very cheap
│     - Slight overlap acceptable
│
└─ DISTANT AGENTS (> 100m from camera)
   └─ Use NOTHING (flow field only)
      - No collision avoidance
      - Agents can overlap
      - Zero CPU cost
```

**Collision Cost Comparison**:

| Method | CPU per Agent | Quality | Overlaps? |
|--------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| RVO | 0.5ms | Excellent (collision-free) | Never |
| Boids + Social Forces | 0.1ms | Good (rare overlap) | Rarely |
| Boids Separation Only | 0.05ms | Acceptable | Occasionally |
| Simple Repulsion | 0.01ms | Poor (frequent overlap) | Often |
| None (flow field only) | 0.001ms | N/A (used for distant agents) | Always |

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended):

```python
def choose_collision_method(agent, camera_position):
    """Select collision method based on agent importance"""
    distance = (agent.position - camera_position).length()

    if agent.is_hero:
        return "RVO"  # Best quality
    elif distance < 30 and is_visible(agent):
        return "boids_social"  # Good quality
    elif distance < 100:
        return "boids_separation"  # Acceptable quality
    else:
        return "none"  # No collision, use flow field
```

### Framework 5: When to Use GPU Simulation

**Question**: Should I move simulation to GPU (compute shaders)?

```
GPU simulation becomes worthwhile when:

├─ AGENT COUNT > 5000
│  └─ CPU can't handle even with LOD
│     - Consider GPU compute shaders
│     - 100× speedup possible
│     - Requires GPU programming knowledge
│
├─ UNIFORM AGENTS (all identical behavior)
│  └─ GPU excels at SIMD (same instruction, many agents)
│     - Example: Zombie horde (all chase player)
│     - Counter-example: NPCs with varied behaviors (bad for GPU)
│
├─ SIMPLE BEHAVIORS (Boids, flow fields)
│  └─ GPU good for simple math
│     - Boids: Good for GPU
│     - RVO: Harder (conditionals, per-agent logic)
│     - Pathfinding: Very hard on GPU
│
└─ TARGET PLATFORM has strong GPU
   └─ PC, Console: GPU usually available
      Mobile: GPU may be busy with rendering
```

**GPU Simulation Pros/Cons**:

**Pros**:
- ✅ 100-1000× faster for simple behaviors
- ✅ Can simulate 50,000+ agents
- ✅ Frees CPU for other tasks

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires GPU programming (CUDA, compute shaders)
- ❌ Hard to debug (no printf, breakpoints limited)
- ❌ Conditionals are slow (if/else on GPU is expensive)
- ❌ CPU-GPU memory transfer is slow (minimize transfers)

**When NOT to Use GPU**:
- Complex decision-making (BTs, GOAP) → Stay on CPU
- Varied agent types (civilians, guards, vendors) → Stay on CPU
- Small agent counts (< 1000) → Not worth complexity

**Real-World Example**: *Unity ECS + Burst Compiler* gives 10-100× speedup without GPU programming.

```

**What This Fixes from RED Failures**:

✅ **O(n²) Performance** → Spatial hash grid makes neighbor queries O(1)
✅ **No LOD** → 4-level LOD system (full, simple, minimal, frozen)
✅ **Missing Boids** → Full implementation (separation, alignment, cohesion)
✅ **Agents Overlapping** → Proper separation force with distance weighting
✅ **Robotic Movement** → Personality parameters (speed, personal space, risk tolerance)
✅ **No Formations** → (Pattern 2 adds formations)
✅ **Jerky Movement** → Smooth steering forces with acceleration limits
✅ **Cannot Scale** → Handles 1000 agents at 60 FPS with LOD
✅ **No Spatial Structure** → Spatial hash grid implemented
✅ **Uniform Agents** → Per-agent personality configuration

**Performance**:
- 1000 agents: ~8-12ms per frame (60 FPS capable)
- Without spatial hash: ~500ms per frame (2 FPS)
- Speedup: 40-60× faster

### Pattern 3: Doorway Flow Control (Edge Case Handling)

Addresses RED failure: "Doorway gridlock - edge case handling missing"

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: O(n²) Neighbor Queries (Performance Death)

**The Mistake**:
```python
# ❌ DISASTER: Every agent checks every other agent
def update_agent(agent, all_agents):
    for other in all_agents:
        if other == agent:
            continue
        distance = (agent.position - other.position).length()
        if distance < 3.0:
            # Avoid...
            pass

# 1000 agents × 1000 checks = 1,000,000 checks per frame
# At 60 FPS: 60,000,000 checks per second
# Result: 0.5 FPS (slideshow)
```

**Why This Fails**:
- **Complexity**: O(n²) - grows quadratically with agent count
- **100 agents**: 10,000 checks (manageable)
- **1000 agents**: 1,000,000 checks (death)
- **Wasted work**: 95% of checks are for distant agents that don't matter

**The Fix**: Spatial Hash Grid

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use spatial structure
class SpatialHashGrid:
    # ... (see Pattern 1)

spatial_grid = SpatialHashGrid(cell_size=3.0)

# Rebuild grid each frame (O(n))
spatial_grid.clear()
for agent in agents:
    spatial_grid.insert(agent)

# Query neighbors (O(1) average)
neighbors = spatial_grid.query_radius(agent.position, radius=3.0)

# 1000 agents × ~10 neighbors = 10,000 checks per frame
# At 60 FPS: 600,000 checks per second
# Speedup: 100× faster!
```

**Performance Math**:
```
Without spatial structure: O(n²)
- 1000 agents: 1,000,000 checks

With spatial hash (cell size = 2 × query radius):
- 1000 agents: ~10,000 checks (each checks ~10 neighbors)
- Speedup: 100×

With spatial hash (badly tuned cell size):
- Cell too small: Many cells to check → O(n) still
- Cell too large: Many agents per cell → O(n²) within cells
- Rule of thumb: cell_size = 2 × neighbor_radius
```

**Red Flags**:
- Double nested loop over all agents
- `for agent in agents: for other in agents:`
- No spatial data structure visible
- Performance degrades rapidly with more agents

---

### Pitfall 2: No LOD System (All Agents Full Detail)

**The Mistake**:
```python
# ❌ All 1000 agents run full simulation every frame
for agent in agents:
    neighbors = find_neighbors(agent)  # Expensive
    agent.update_boids(neighbors)      # Expensive
    agent.update_rvo(neighbors)        # Very expensive
    agent.calculate_path()             # Extremely expensive

# Every agent gets same CPU time regardless of:
# - Distance from camera (500m away = same as 5m away)
# - Visibility (off-screen = same as on-screen)
# - Importance (background NPC = same as hero)

# Result: 50ms per frame (20 FPS) with 1000 agents
```

**Why This Fails**:
- **Player can only see ~100 agents** at once (60° FOV, distance culling)
- **Simulating 900 invisible agents** at full detail
- **Wasted CPU**: 90% of compute on agents player can't see
- **Cannot scale**: Adding more agents linearly degrades FPS

**The Fix**: Multi-Level LOD

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: LOD system based on distance/visibility
class LODManager:
    def update_agent_lod(self, agent, camera_pos):
        distance = (agent.position - camera_pos).length()

        if distance < 30:
            # LOD 0: Full simulation (60 Hz)
            agent.lod_level = 0
            agent.update_frequency = 1  # Every frame
        elif distance < 100:
            # LOD 1: Simple simulation (30 Hz)
            agent.lod_level = 1
            agent.update_frequency = 2  # Every 2nd frame
        elif distance < 200:
            # LOD 2: Minimal simulation (10 Hz)
            agent.lod_level = 2
            agent.update_frequency = 6  # Every 6th frame
        else:
            # LOD 3: Frozen (no simulation)
            agent.lod_level = 3

# Update with LOD awareness
if frame % agent.update_frequency == 0:
    if agent.lod_level == 0:
        agent.update_full()  # Boids + RVO + pathfinding
    elif agent.lod_level == 1:
        agent.update_simple()  # Boids separation only
    elif agent.lod_level == 2:
        agent.update_minimal()  # Follow flow field only
    # LOD 3: No update

# Result: 8ms per frame (60 FPS) with 1000 agents!
```

**LOD Performance Impact**:
```
1000 agents, camera in center of crowd:

Without LOD:
- 1000 agents × 0.05ms (full sim) = 50ms per frame
- FPS: 20 (unplayable)

With 4-level LOD:
- 50 agents × 0.05ms (LOD 0, full sim) = 2.5ms
- 200 agents × 0.025ms (LOD 1, simple sim at 30 Hz) = 2.5ms
- 400 agents × 0.01ms (LOD 2, minimal sim at 10 Hz) = 1.3ms
- 350 agents × 0ms (LOD 3, frozen) = 0ms
- Total: 6.3ms per frame
- FPS: 60+ (playable!)

Speedup: 8× faster
```

**When LOD is Mandatory**:
- **< 50 agents**: Optional (can run full sim at 60 FPS)
- **50-200 agents**: Recommended (rendering bottleneck)
- **200-1000 agents**: Required (simulation bottleneck)
- **1000+ agents**: Absolutely mandatory + GPU consideration

---

### Pitfall 3: Missing Boids Algorithm (Unrealistic Crowd Flow)

**The Mistake**:
```python
# ❌ Only simple goal-seeking, no crowd dynamics
def update_agent(agent):
    # Move toward goal
    direction = (agent.goal - agent.position).normalized()
    agent.position += direction * agent.speed * dt

    # Simple collision: push away if overlapping
    for other in nearby_agents:
        if overlapping(agent, other):
            push_apart(agent, other)

# Result:
# - Agents spread out randomly (no cohesion)
# - Everyone goes different direction (no alignment)
# - Constant collisions and bouncing (poor separation)
# - Looks like ants, not humans
```

**Why This Fails**:
- **No emergence**: Crowd behavior doesn't emerge from local rules
- **No flow**: Agents don't form natural streams
- **Reactive only**: Only responds after collision, no anticipation
- **Looks fake**: Players immediately notice unrealistic behavior

**The Fix**: Implement Boids

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Full Boids implementation
def update_agent(agent, neighbors):
    # Rule 1: Separation (avoid crowding)
    separation = calculate_separation(agent, neighbors)

    # Rule 2: Alignment (match neighbor velocity)
    alignment = calculate_alignment(agent, neighbors)

    # Rule 3: Cohesion (stay with group)
    cohesion = calculate_cohesion(agent, neighbors)

    # Goal seeking (where agent wants to go)
    goal_seek = calculate_goal_seek(agent)

    # Combine forces with weights
    total_force = (
        separation * 1.5 +  # Strongest (avoid collisions)
        alignment * 1.0 +
        cohesion * 1.0 +
        goal_seek * 1.2
    )

    # Update velocity (steering)
    agent.velocity += total_force * dt
    agent.velocity = agent.velocity.limit(agent.max_speed)
    agent.position += agent.velocity * dt

# Result:
# - Natural crowd flow and lanes
# - Groups stay together
# - Smooth avoidance (no bouncing)
# - Looks realistic
```

**Boids Impact on Realism**:

| Without Boids | With Boids |
|---------------|------------|
| Random scatter | Natural clustering |
| Chaotic directions | Uniform flow |
| Constant collisions | Smooth avoidance |
| Agents spread out | Groups stay together |
| Looks like ants | Looks like humans |

**Tuning for Different Crowds**:

```python
# Panicked crowd (evacuation)
separation_weight = 0.8  # Less personal space
alignment_weight = 1.5   # Follow crowd strongly
cohesion_weight = 0.5    # Don't care about staying together
goal_weight = 2.0        # Urgently reach exit

# Casual stroll (park)
separation_weight = 2.0  # More personal space
alignment_weight = 0.8   # Don't care about others' direction
cohesion_weight = 1.2    # Stay with friends/family
goal_weight = 1.0        # Leisurely pace

# Military march
separation_weight = 1.5  # Maintain spacing
alignment_weight = 3.0   # Perfect synchronization
cohesion_weight = 2.0    # Tight formation
goal_weight = 1.5        # Follow route
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Agents Overlapping (Insufficient Separation)

**The Mistake**:
```python
# ❌ Weak separation force
def calculate_separation(agent, neighbors):
    steering = Vector2(0, 0)

    for other in neighbors:
        distance = (agent.position - other.position).length()
        if distance < 2.0:
            # Push away
            diff = agent.position - other.position
            steering += diff  # NOT weighted by distance!

    return steering

# Result:
# - Close agents don't repel strongly enough
# - Agents overlap and clip through each other
# - Visual artifacts (heads inside bodies)
```

**Why This Fails**:
- **Not weighted by distance**: Agent 0.1m away has same force as agent 1.9m away
- **Too weak**: Force magnitude too small to overcome goal-seeking
- **No emergency handling**: Doesn't handle already-overlapping agents

**The Fix**: Distance-Weighted Separation + Emergency Mode

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Distance-weighted separation with emergency handling
def calculate_separation(agent, neighbors):
    steering = Vector2(0, 0)
    count = 0

    for other in neighbors:
        diff = agent.position - other.position
        distance = diff.length()

        if distance < 0.01:
            # Emergency: Already overlapping badly
            # Apply maximum repulsion in random direction
            angle = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)
            emergency_force = Vector2(math.cos(angle), math.sin(angle))
            return emergency_force * agent.max_force * 5.0  # STRONG force

        if 0 < distance < agent.separation_radius:
            # Weight by inverse distance (closer = stronger)
            # 1/distance means: 0.5m away → 2× force, 0.25m → 4× force
            diff = diff.normalized() / distance
            steering += diff
            count += 1

    if count > 0:
        steering /= count

        # Calculate steering force
        steering = steering.normalized() * agent.max_speed
        steering -= agent.velocity
        steering = steering.limit(agent.max_force)

    return steering

# Also: Increase separation weight
separation_force = calculate_separation(agent, neighbors)
total_force = separation_force * 2.0 + other_forces  # Strong weight!
```

**Separation Tuning**:

```python
# Too weak (agents overlap)
separation_weight = 0.5
separation_radius = 1.0

# Good (no overlap)
separation_weight = 1.5
separation_radius = 2.0

# Too strong (agents avoid too much, sparse crowd)
separation_weight = 5.0
separation_radius = 5.0
```

**Visual Check**:
- Draw agent collision circles in debug mode
- **Red flag**: Circles overlapping → separation too weak
- **Good**: Circles touch but don't overlap
- **Too strong**: Large gaps between agents

---

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Edge Cases (Doorways, Corners, Dead Ends)

**The Mistake**:
```python
# ❌ Only handles open space scenarios
# No special handling for:
# - Narrow doorways (agents pile up, gridlock)
# - Corners (agents get stuck)
# - Dead ends (agents never escape)
# - Stairs/slopes (agents slide)

# Result:
# - Simulation breaks in constrained spaces
# - Players notice immediately (very visible)
# - Requires manual intervention or restart
```

**Why This Fails**:
- **Boids assumes open space**: Works great in fields, breaks in buildings
- **No flow control**: All agents try to push through door simultaneously
- **No deadlock detection**: Agents wait forever in corners
- **No escape behavior**: Can't back out of dead ends

**The Fix**: Special Case Handlers

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Edge case handling

# 1. Doorway Manager (prevents gridlock)
class DoorwayManager:
    def manage_flow(self, agents, doorway):
        # Limit flow rate (1.5 agents/second)
        # Create queue before doorway
        # Assign queue slots to waiting agents
        # See Pattern 3 for full implementation

# 2. Corner Escape
def check_stuck_in_corner(agent):
    if agent.stuck_timer > 3.0:  # Stuck for 3 seconds
        # Check if in corner (velocity near zero, goal far away)
        speed = agent.velocity.length()
        distance_to_goal = (agent.goal - agent.position).length()

        if speed < 0.1 and distance_to_goal > 5.0:
            # Stuck! Add random wander to escape
            random_direction = Vector2(
                random.uniform(-1, 1),
                random.uniform(-1, 1)
            ).normalized()

            agent.velocity += random_direction * agent.max_speed * 0.5
            agent.stuck_timer = 0  # Reset

# 3. Dead End Detection
def detect_dead_end(agent):
    # Raycast toward goal
    ray_hit = raycast(agent.position, agent.goal)

    if ray_hit.hit_wall:
        # Check if alternate path exists
        alternate = find_alternate_path(agent.position, agent.goal)

        if not alternate:
            # Dead end! Find nearest open area
            agent.goal = find_nearest_open_space(agent.position)

# 4. Panic Mode (evacuations)
def handle_panic(agent, threat_position):
    # In panic:
    # - Increase speed (1.3× normal)
    # - Reduce personal space (0.5× normal)
    # - Follow crowd more strongly (alignment weight 2×)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Assassin's Creed Unity - 10,000 NPC Crowds

**Scale**: 10,000+ NPCs in Paris streets, Revolution-era protests and riots.

**Technical Approach**:

1. **5-Level LOD System**:
   - **LOD 0** (< 10m): Full skeleton, cloth sim, unique animations
   - **LOD 1** (10-30m): Simplified skeleton, baked cloth, shared anims
   - **LOD 2** (30-100m): Low-poly mesh, 3-bone skeleton
   - **LOD 3** (100-200m): Impostor (billboard sprite)
   - **LOD 4** (> 200m): Culled (not rendered)

2. **Simulation LOD**:
   - Close NPCs: Full AI (behavior tree, pathfinding, reactions)
   - Medium NPCs: Simplified (scripted paths, basic avoidance)
   - Far NPCs: Animated sprites (no simulation)

3. **Crowd Behaviors**:
   - **Normal state**: Boids with goal-seeking (shops, homes, work)
   - **Riot state**: Increased density, following flow fields toward objectives
   - **Panic state**: Fleeing from threats (player, guards, explosions)

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Spatial hashing for collision queries
   - GPU instancing for rendering (1000+ NPCs per draw call)
   - Async pathfinding (time-sliced over 5 frames)
   - Shared animation state machines

**Result**: 30-60 FPS with 10,000 NPCs on PS4/Xbox One.

**Key Lesson**: LOD is mandatory at this scale. Visual LOD reduces rendering cost 100×, behavior LOD reduces simulation cost 50×.

### Example 2: Total War: Three Kingdoms - Formation Battles

**Scale**: 10,000+ soldiers in tight formations, real-time battles.

**Technical Approach**:

1. **Unit-Based Architecture**:
   - Units of 100-200 soldiers treated as single entity
   - Formation shape (square, wedge, circle) assigned to unit
   - Individual soldiers maintain slot in formation

2. **Formation Maintenance**:
   ```
   Each soldier:
   - Assigned slot position relative to unit center
   - Steers toward slot (90% of force)
   - Avoids nearby soldiers (10% of force)
   - If pushed > 5m from slot, breaks formation and catches up
   ```

3. **Combat Simulation**:
   - Only front-rank soldiers engage (20-30 per unit)
   - Back ranks wait in formation
   - When front soldier dies, back soldier moves forward

4. **LOD System**:
   - **Player's camera focus**: Full simulation + high-detail mesh
   - **Same screen but distant**: Simplified simulation + medium mesh
   - **Off-screen**: Scripted combat (no individual simulation) + low mesh

**Result**: 20,000 soldiers at 40-60 FPS on mid-range PCs.

**Key Lesson**: Formation system allows large armies while keeping simulation tractable. Treating 100 soldiers as 1 unit reduces simulation cost 100×.

### Example 3: Cities: Skylines - Traffic and Pedestrian Simulation

**Scale**: 1 million+ citizens (not all active), 100,000+ active vehicles/pedestrians.

**Technical Approach**:

1. **Citizen Lifecycle**:
   - Most citizens simulated abstractly (not rendered)
   - Only citizens in player's viewport rendered and simulated
   - When leaving viewport, citizen converted to abstract state

2. **Pathfinding**:
   - Hierarchical pathfinding (highways → arterials → local streets)
   - Path caching (common routes stored, reused)
   - Time-sliced (10ms budget per frame, rest queued)

3. **Crowd Movement**:
   - Pedestrians use Boids in dense areas (parks, plazas)
   - Sidewalks use scripted flow (follow path, no collision)
   - Crosswalks have flow managers (queue, wait for signal)

4. **Performance**:
   - Only ~1000 agents actively simulated at once
   - Rest in "hibernation" (position updated, no collision/avoidance)
   - Transition from hibernation → active as camera approaches

**Result**: Simulate cities of 1M+ citizens with 10,000 active agents at 30-60 FPS.

**Key Lesson**: Most agents don't need full simulation. Aggressive culling and hibernation allow huge scale.

### Example 4: Half-Life: Alyx - Dense Urban Crowds (VR)

**Scale**: 50-100 NPCs in dense city streets (City 17).

**Technical Approach**:

1. **VR Constraints**:
   - Must maintain 90 FPS (VR sickness if drops)
   - Higher render cost than flat games
   - CPU budget: 8ms per frame for ALL simulation

2. **Optimization for VR**:
   - Strict agent limit (max 100 active)
   - Aggressive LOD (3 levels, tight thresholds)
   - No distant crowds (culled aggressively)

3. **Quality Focus**:
   - Few agents, but high quality
   - Full RVO (collision-free movement)
   - Individual personalities (speed, animation, reactions)
   - High-detail meshes even at medium distance

4. **Scripted vs Simulated**:
   - 70% of crowd is scripted (walk on rails)
   - 30% fully simulated (respond to player)
   - Scripted NPCs transition to simulated when player interacts

**Result**: 50-100 NPCs at 90 FPS in VR.

**Key Lesson**: VR requires strict performance budgets. Quality over quantity - fewer agents with better simulation is more believable.

### Example 5: Crowd Simulation for Safety Analysis (Real-World)

**Use Case**: Stadium evacuation planning, subway crowd management.

**Technical Approach**:

1. **Validation Against Reality**:
   - Calibrate agent parameters using real crowd data
   - Match observed densities, flow rates, exit times
   - Academic rigor: Social Forces model (Helbing et al.)

2. **Agent Heterogeneity**:
   - Elderly: Slower speed (0.8 m/s vs 1.4 m/s average)
   - Children: Smaller personal space, follow parents
   - Mobility-impaired: Wheelchairs, crutches (0.5 m/s)
   - Distribution: 10% elderly, 5% children, 2% mobility-impaired

3. **Panic Modeling**:
   - Normal: Personal space 0.8m, orderly queues
   - Stress: Personal space 0.5m, pushing increases
   - Panic: Personal space 0.2m, stampede risk

4. **Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - Identify chokepoints (doorways, stairs)
   - Measure flow rates (agents/second)
   - Detect crush risks (density > 5.5 people/m²)

**Result**: Accurate evacuation time predictions (±10% of real drills).

**Key Lesson**: Realism matters for safety. Must validate against real-world data, not just "looks good."

## Summary

**Crowd simulation is about emergent behavior from simple local rules**:
- **Boids three rules** → Natural flocking without central coordination
- **Spatial partitioning** → O(1) neighbor queries instead of O(n²)
- **LOD hierarchy** → Only simulate what matters (near agents full detail, far agents frozen)
- **Edge case handling** → Special logic for doorways, corners, panic

**The most critical insight**: **You're not simulating 1000 individuals, you're simulating a crowd system.** Treat it as a system with spatial optimization, not 1000 separate agents.

**When implementing**:
1. Start with spatial hash (fixes O(n²) immediately)
2. Add basic Boids (separation, alignment, cohesion)
3. Add LOD system (3-4 levels based on distance)
4. Add formations (groups stay together)
5. Handle edge cases (doorways, corners)
6. Add personality variation (speed, spacing)

**Performance is non-negotiable**: If you can't hit 60 FPS with 1000 agents, you've failed the requirement. LOD + spatial hash are mandatory, not optional.

**Test at scale early**: 10 agents works very differently than 1000 agents. Don't wait until beta to test performance.

**The 80/20 rule**: Get 80% of realism with 20% of effort. Boids + spatial hash + 3-level LOD gives you production-quality crowds. Anything beyond that (RVO, formations, personalities) is polish.

**Architecture matters**: Separate simulation from rendering. Agent shouldn't know HOW it's rendered, only that it has a position/velocity. This allows swapping rendering (mesh vs impostor vs GPU instanced) without changing simulation.
