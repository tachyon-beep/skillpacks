# Using Simulation Tactics: The Router Meta-Skill

## Description

This is the PRIMARY ROUTER META-SKILL for the simulation-tactics skillpack. It teaches you how to:

1. **Analyze simulation requirements** - Understand what the user actually needs
2. **Route to appropriate skills** - Determine which of the 10 core skills apply
3. **Apply skills in correct order** - Use the optimal workflow for the situation
4. **Combine multiple skills** - Handle complex scenarios requiring several simulation types

This skill does NOT teach simulation implementation details. It teaches DECISION MAKING: which skill to use, when, and why.

## When to Use This Meta-Skill

Use this meta-skill when:
- Starting ANY simulation-related game development task
- User asks about simulation but unclear which type
- Facing complex scenarios requiring multiple simulation types
- Need to determine implementation order for multi-system games
- Debugging simulation issues and unclear where to start
- Planning architecture for simulation-heavy games

## The 10 Core Skills

Before routing, understand what each skill provides:

### 1. simulation-vs-faking (FOUNDATIONAL)
**What it teaches**: The fundamental trade-off between full simulation and approximation/faking
**When to route**: ALWAYS FIRST - determines if you even need simulation
**Key question**: "Do I simulate this, fake it, or use a hybrid approach?"

### 2. physics-simulation-patterns
**What it teaches**: Rigid bodies, vehicles, cloth, fluids, integration methods
**When to route**: Need realistic physics for vehicles, ragdolls, destructibles, or fluid dynamics
**Key question**: "Does this need real-time physics simulation?"

### 3. ai-and-agent-simulation
**What it teaches**: FSM, behavior trees, utility AI, GOAP, agent behaviors
**When to route**: Need intelligent agent behavior (enemies, NPCs, units)
**Key question**: "Do agents need to make decisions and act autonomously?"

### 4. traffic-and-pathfinding
**What it teaches**: A*, navmesh, flow fields, traffic simulation, congestion
**When to route**: Need agents to navigate environments or simulate traffic
**Key question**: "Do entities need to find paths or simulate traffic flow?"

### 5. economic-simulation-patterns
**What it teaches**: Supply/demand, markets, trade networks, price discovery
**When to route**: Need economic systems (trading, markets, resources)
**Key question**: "Does the game involve trade, economy, or resource markets?"

### 6. ecosystem-simulation
**What it teaches**: Predator-prey dynamics, food chains, population control
**When to route**: Need living ecosystems with wildlife populations
**Key question**: "Do I need animals/plants that breed, eat, and die naturally?"

### 7. crowd-simulation
**What it teaches**: Boids, formations, social forces, LOD for crowds
**When to route**: Need large groups moving together (crowds, flocks, armies)
**Key question**: "Do I need many entities moving as a coordinated group?"

### 8. weather-and-time
**What it teaches**: Day/night cycles, weather systems, seasonal effects
**When to route**: Need atmospheric effects or time-based gameplay
**Key question**: "Does the game need time progression or weather?"

### 9. performance-optimization-for-sims
**What it teaches**: Profiling, spatial partitioning, LOD, time-slicing, caching
**When to route**: Performance problems with existing simulation
**Key question**: "Is my simulation too slow?"

### 10. debugging-simulation-chaos
**What it teaches**: Systematic debugging, desync detection, determinism, chaos prevention
**When to route**: Simulation behaves incorrectly, chaotically, or unpredictably
**Key question**: "Is my simulation broken, desyncing, or chaotic?"

### Key Routing Principles

**Principle 1: simulation-vs-faking is ALWAYS step 1**
- Even if you "know" you need simulation, validate this assumption
- Prevents 90% of over-engineering disasters
- Takes 5 minutes, saves hours of wasted work

**Principle 2: Multiple domains are common**
- Most games need 2-4 simulation types
- Route to ALL applicable skills
- Order matters (see workflow patterns below)

**Principle 3: Optimization comes AFTER implementation**
- Don't route to performance-optimization-for-sims until you have a working simulation
- Profile first, optimize later
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil

**Principle 4: Debugging is reactive, not proactive**
- Only route to debugging-simulation-chaos when something is broken
- Don't use it as a preventative measure
- Fix the bug, THEN refactor to prevent recurrence

## ROUTING SCENARIOS: 20 Examples

### Scenario 1: "I want realistic vehicle physics"

**Analysis**: Needs physics simulation for vehicle dynamics

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Confirm physics is needed (vs kinematic movement)
2. physics-simulation-patterns → Implement vehicle physics

**Why**: Vehicles benefit from real physics (suspension, friction, weight transfer). Players notice when physics feels wrong.

---

### Scenario 2: "I need traffic in my city builder"

**Analysis**: Needs pathfinding and traffic flow for many vehicles

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine level of detail (full per-vehicle sim vs aggregate flow)
2. traffic-and-pathfinding → Implement pathfinding and traffic simulation

**Why**: City builders need traffic that looks realistic but can scale to thousands of vehicles. Full physics per-vehicle would be overkill.

---

### Scenario 3: "I'm building an RTS game"

**Analysis**: Multiple simulation domains (AI, pathfinding, possibly physics)

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine what level of detail for each system
2. ai-and-agent-simulation → Unit AI and decision making
3. traffic-and-pathfinding → Unit movement and formation pathfinding
4. (Optional) physics-simulation-patterns → If units have physics-based movement

**Why**: RTS games need multiple simulation types working together. Order matters: AI decides what to do, pathfinding determines how to get there, physics (if used) handles movement.

---

### Scenario 4: "My ecosystem keeps collapsing"

**Analysis**: Existing simulation is broken (extinction, runaway growth, chaos)

**Routing**:
1. debugging-simulation-chaos → Systematic investigation of collapse
2. ecosystem-simulation → Review and fix population dynamics

**Why**: This is a bug/chaos situation, so debugging comes first. After identifying root cause, use ecosystem skill to fix the math.

---

### Scenario 5: "Frame rate drops with 1000 agents"

**Analysis**: Performance bottleneck in existing simulation

**Routing**:
1. performance-optimization-for-sims → Profile and optimize

**Why**: This is a pure performance problem. No need to revisit design—just optimize what exists.

---

### Scenario 6: "I need realistic NPC daily routines"

**Analysis**: Agent behavior and time systems

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Do NPCs need full daily simulation or scheduled events?
2. ai-and-agent-simulation → NPC decision making and behaviors
3. weather-and-time → Day/night cycle for scheduling

**Why**: Daily routines involve both AI (what NPCs do) and time (when they do it). simulation-vs-faking determines if you simulate every minute or teleport NPCs between scheduled activities.

---

### Scenario 7: "I'm making a survival game with hunting"

**Analysis**: Multiple domains (ecosystem, AI, physics)

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine simulation detail level
2. ecosystem-simulation → Animal populations and reproduction
3. ai-and-agent-simulation → Animal behaviors (flee, hunt, graze)
4. (Optional) physics-simulation-patterns → If using ragdolls or physics-based hunting

**Why**: Survival games need functioning ecosystems with believable animal behavior.

---

### Scenario 8: "I need a trading system for my MMO"

**Analysis**: Economic simulation with many players

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine if you need simulated economy or just UI
2. economic-simulation-patterns → Implement supply/demand and markets

**Why**: MMO economies are critical gameplay systems. Must decide if NPCs are simulated traders or just price-setting mechanisms.

---

### Scenario 9: "I want flocking birds in the background"

**Analysis**: Visual effect with crowd behavior

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Birds are background, so probably fake or very simple
2. crowd-simulation → If simulating, use boids algorithm with heavy LOD

**Why**: Background birds don't need full simulation. Simple boids with aggressive LOD gives convincing results cheaply.

---

### Scenario 10: "My physics simulation explodes randomly"

**Analysis**: Physics instability bug

**Routing**:
1. debugging-simulation-chaos → Identify NaN sources, instability triggers
2. physics-simulation-patterns → Review integration method and constraints

**Why**: Physics explosions are a specific bug pattern. Debug first to identify the trigger (divide-by-zero, large timesteps, constraint failures).

---

### Scenario 11: "I need weather that affects gameplay"

**Analysis**: Atmospheric effects with gameplay integration

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine weather complexity (scripted vs simulated)
2. weather-and-time → Implement weather systems and effects

**Why**: Gameplay-affecting weather needs more than visual effects. Must integrate with movement, visibility, audio, etc.

---

### Scenario 12: "I want a battle royale storm circle"

**Analysis**: Zone simulation with player effects

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Storm is gameplay mechanic, not realistic weather
2. (Skip detailed simulation) → Just implement zone shrinking with damage

**Why**: Battle royale storms are game mechanics disguised as weather. No need for simulation-tactics at all—just implement the zone math directly.

---

### Scenario 13: "My multiplayer game desyncs constantly"

**Analysis**: Determinism failure causing desyncs

**Routing**:
1. debugging-simulation-chaos → Identify sources of non-determinism
2. (Revisit implementation skills) → Fix simulation to be deterministic

**Why**: Desyncs are always determinism bugs. Debug first to find the non-deterministic code (floating point, random, iteration order).

---

### Scenario 14: "I need crowds for a stadium game"

**Analysis**: Large crowds, mostly visual

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Crowds are background, so heavy faking likely
2. crowd-simulation → If needed, use heavy LOD (simulate near, animate far)

**Why**: Stadium crowds are visual atmosphere. Most can be animated sprites. Only simulate visible, close crowds.

---

### Scenario 15: "I'm making a city builder with seasons"

**Analysis**: Multiple systems (time, economy, possibly ecosystem)

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine simulation vs scripted events
2. weather-and-time → Seasons and time progression
3. economic-simulation-patterns → Seasonal resource production changes
4. (Optional) ecosystem-simulation → If wildlife/farming is simulated

**Why**: Seasons affect multiple systems. Time system is the core, but economy and ecosystem may need seasonal adjustments.

---

### Scenario 16: "I want realistic wind affecting projectiles"

**Analysis**: Physics simulation with environmental forces

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Is wind gameplay-critical or just visual?
2. physics-simulation-patterns → Add wind force to projectile integration

**Why**: If wind is gameplay-critical (archery, golf), simulate it in physics. If just visual, fake it with particle effects.

---

### Scenario 17: "I need zombie hordes pathfinding to players"

**Analysis**: Large-scale pathfinding with crowd behavior

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Determine per-zombie detail level
2. traffic-and-pathfinding → Flow fields or hierarchical pathfinding
3. crowd-simulation → Zombie horde movement and avoidance
4. ai-and-agent-simulation → Individual zombie behaviors (attack, wander)

**Why**: Zombie hordes need scalable pathfinding (flow fields) and crowd behavior. Individual AI can be simple utility-based decisions.

---

### Scenario 18: "I'm making a fishing game"

**Analysis**: Ecosystem simulation with simple physics

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Do fish need full ecosystem or just spawn management?
2. ecosystem-simulation → If full ecosystem, use population dynamics
3. ai-and-agent-simulation → Fish behaviors (schooling, feeding, fleeing)
4. (Optional) physics-simulation-patterns → Rod physics and fish fighting

**Why**: Fishing games can range from arcade (fake everything) to simulation (full ecosystem). simulation-vs-faking determines the approach.

---

### Scenario 19: "I need a day/night cycle but no weather"

**Analysis**: Time system only

**Routing**:
1. simulation-vs-faking → Simple time cycle, no need for complex simulation
2. weather-and-time → Implement day/night cycle (skip weather section)

**Why**: Day/night cycles are straightforward. Use weather-and-time skill but skip the weather simulation parts.

---

### Scenario 20: "My steering behaviors make agents jitter"

**Analysis**: Implementation bug in agent movement

**Routing**:
1. debugging-simulation-chaos → Identify jitter source (probably oscillation)
2. ai-and-agent-simulation → Review steering behavior math and damping

**Why**: Jittering is a specific bug (agents oscillating around target). Debug to confirm, then fix in AI implementation.

---

## COMMON ROUTING MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Skipping simulation-vs-faking
**Symptom**: Over-engineered simulation that could have been faked

**Example**:
- Building full ecosystem for background birds that are never scrutinized
- Simulating NPC hunger/sleep when player never notices
- Full traffic simulation for distant cars player can't interact with

**Fix**: ALWAYS route to simulation-vs-faking first. Ask "Will player notice if I fake this?"

**Cost of mistake**: Weeks of wasted work, ongoing performance burden

---

### Mistake 2: Premature optimization
**Symptom**: Routing to performance-optimization-for-sims before implementation is complete

**Example**:
- Implementing LOD systems before having working simulation
- Using spatial partitioning before knowing if it's needed
- Caching pathfinding before pathfinding exists

**Fix**: Profile first, optimize later. Only route to performance-optimization-for-sims when:
- You have working simulation
- You have measured performance problem
- Profiler shows bottleneck

**Cost of mistake**: Wasted time optimizing code that might change, or optimizing the wrong thing

---

### Mistake 3: Not debugging systematically
**Symptom**: Trying to fix bugs by changing random things, routing to implementation skills instead of debugging-simulation-chaos

**Example**:
- "Physics explodes, let me try different integration method" (should debug first)
- "Ecosystem collapses, let me add more food" (should debug why it collapses)
- "Pathfinding breaks, let me rewrite the algorithm" (should debug the existing code)

**Fix**: When simulation is broken, ALWAYS route to debugging-simulation-chaos first. Identify root cause before attempting fixes.

**Cost of mistake**: Bug persists, or you "fix" symptom without addressing cause

---

### Mistake 4: Wrong skill for the domain
**Symptom**: Using ai-and-agent-simulation when you need traffic-and-pathfinding, etc.

**Example**:
- Using ai-and-agent-simulation for pathfinding (use traffic-and-pathfinding instead)
- Using physics-simulation-patterns for kinematic movement (use ai-and-agent-simulation)
- Using crowd-simulation for trading (use economic-simulation-patterns)

**Fix**: Understand what each skill covers. Pathfinding is NOT AI. Physics is NOT movement. Crowds are NOT flocking AI.

**Cost of mistake**: Learning wrong techniques for your problem

---

### Mistake 5: Implementing in wrong order
**Symptom**: Building dependent system before foundation

**Example**:
- Implementing AI behaviors before pathfinding exists (AI can't move)
- Building economy before resource sources exist (nothing to trade)
- Adding weather effects before day/night cycle (no time progression)

**Fix**: Follow the dependency order in multi-skill workflows. Foundation first, then dependent systems.

**Cost of mistake**: Rework when foundation changes breaks dependent systems

---

### Mistake 6: Ignoring multiplayer determinism
**Symptom**: Building single-player simulation without considering multiplayer needs

**Example**:
- Using floating-point physics for multiplayer game (desyncs)
- Random number generation without shared seed (desyncs)
- Iterating unordered collections (desyncs)

**Fix**: If multiplayer is planned, route to debugging-simulation-chaos early to learn determinism requirements.

**Cost of mistake**: Complete rewrite to fix desyncs

---

### Mistake 7: Over-combining skills
**Symptom**: Trying to use every skill when only 1-2 are needed

**Example**:
- Simple puzzle game doesn't need ecosystem-simulation
- Turn-based game doesn't need performance-optimization-for-sims
- Static world doesn't need weather-and-time

**Fix**: Route to ONLY the skills you actually need. More skills = more complexity.

**Cost of mistake**: Wasted time learning and implementing unnecessary systems

## EXPERT ROUTING TIPS

### Tip 1: Listen for hidden requirements
Users often describe WHAT they want without understanding WHICH simulation type they need.

**Examples**:
- "I want intelligent enemies" → Could be ai-and-agent-simulation OR traffic-and-pathfinding OR both
- "I need realistic physics" → Could be physics-simulation-patterns OR just kinematic movement
- "I want a living world" → Could be ecosystem-simulation OR ai-and-agent-simulation OR weather-and-time

**Fix**: Ask clarifying questions:
- "Do enemies need to navigate complex terrain?" (pathfinding)
- "Do enemies need to make tactical decisions?" (AI)
- "Does 'living world' mean wildlife, weather, or both?" (ecosystem vs weather)

### Tip 2: Recognize anti-patterns
Some phrases indicate the user is heading toward common mistakes:

**Red flags**:
- "I want to simulate EVERYTHING" → Over-engineering, route to simulation-vs-faking
- "It needs to be perfectly realistic" → Perfectionism trap, route to simulation-vs-faking
- "I'll optimize later" → True, but ensure they know when "later" is (after profiling)
- "I changed one parameter and it exploded" → Chaos, route to debugging-simulation-chaos
- "It works on my machine but desyncs in multiplayer" → Determinism bug, route to debugging-simulation-chaos

### Tip 3: Recognize interdependencies
Some skill combinations have ordering requirements:

**Dependencies**:
- ai-and-agent-simulation depends on traffic-and-pathfinding (if agents need to navigate)
- crowd-simulation depends on traffic-and-pathfinding (for underlying navigation)
- ecosystem-simulation depends on ai-and-agent-simulation (for animal behaviors)
- performance-optimization-for-sims depends on having working simulation first

**Rule**: Foundation skills (simulation-vs-faking, core implementations) before dependent skills (optimization, debugging)

### Tip 4: Scale determines routing
The number of entities changes which skills are needed:

**Scale breakpoints**:
- **< 10 entities**: Basic implementation, no special optimization
- **10-100 entities**: May need performance-optimization-for-sims
- **100-1000 entities**: Definitely need performance-optimization-for-sims, spatial partitioning, LOD
- **1000+ entities**: Need aggressive optimization, time-slicing, hybrid LOD

**Example**: "I need 10 NPCs" vs "I need 10,000 NPCs" route to same implementation skill, but latter ALSO routes to performance-optimization-for-sims.

### Tip 5: Genre provides context
Game genre suggests which skills are commonly needed:

**Genre routing patterns**:
- **RTS/Strategy**: ai-and-agent-simulation + traffic-and-pathfinding + performance-optimization
- **Survival**: ecosystem-simulation + ai-and-agent-simulation + weather-and-time
- **City Builder**: traffic-and-pathfinding + economic-simulation + simulation-vs-faking
- **Racing**: physics-simulation-patterns + performance-optimization
- **MMO**: economic-simulation + debugging-simulation-chaos (determinism)
- **Open World**: traffic-and-pathfinding + crowd-simulation + weather-and-time
- **Battle Royale**: simulation-vs-faking (aggressive LOD) + debugging-simulation-chaos (determinism)

Don't over-assume based on genre, but use it as a starting hypothesis.

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

When routing to multiple skills, use this checklist to ensure proper workflow:

### Phase 1: Planning (Always First)
- [ ] Route to simulation-vs-faking
- [ ] Identify all applicable simulation domains
- [ ] Determine implementation order based on dependencies
- [ ] Validate that simulation is actually needed

### Phase 2: Implementation (Core Systems)
- [ ] Implement foundation skills first (pathfinding before AI, etc.)
- [ ] Test each system independently before integration
- [ ] Ensure determinism if multiplayer is planned
- [ ] Validate against "good enough" threshold from simulation-vs-faking

### Phase 3: Integration (Combining Systems)
- [ ] Integrate systems in dependency order
- [ ] Test combined systems at target scale
- [ ] Profile to identify bottlenecks (if any)

### Phase 4: Optimization (Only If Needed)
- [ ] Profile to measure performance
- [ ] Route to performance-optimization-for-sims only if bottleneck exists
- [ ] Re-test after optimization
- [ ] Validate gameplay still feels correct

### Phase 5: Debugging (Only If Broken)
- [ ] Route to debugging-simulation-chaos if bugs occur
- [ ] Use systematic debugging process
- [ ] Fix root cause, not symptoms
- [ ] Add prevention measures

## META-SKILL SELF-CHECK

After using this meta-skill, verify your routing with these questions:

**Routing accuracy**:
- [ ] Did I start with simulation-vs-faking?
- [ ] Did I identify ALL applicable simulation domains?
- [ ] Did I avoid routing to performance-optimization-for-sims prematurely?
- [ ] Did I only route to debugging-simulation-chaos for actual bugs?

**Workflow correctness**:
- [ ] Am I implementing foundation skills before dependent skills?
- [ ] Have I considered interdependencies between skills?
- [ ] Is the implementation order logical?

**Efficiency**:
- [ ] Am I using the minimum skills needed?
- [ ] Have I avoided over-engineering?
- [ ] Am I respecting the "good enough" threshold?

**Completeness**:
- [ ] Have I considered multiplayer determinism (if applicable)?
- [ ] Have I planned for scale (if thousands of entities)?
- [ ] Have I validated gameplay implications?

## ADVANCED ROUTING: Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: "I don't know what kind of simulation I need"
**Symptom**: User describes game but unclear which simulation domains apply

**Process**:
1. Route to simulation-vs-faking anyway (helps clarify requirements)
2. Ask probing questions about specific systems:
   - "Do you have moving agents?" (pathfinding/AI)
   - "Is there combat?" (physics/AI)
   - "Is there economy/trading?" (economic)
   - "Is there wildlife?" (ecosystem)
3. Route to identified domains

**Example**: "I'm making a survival game" → Ask about hunting (ecosystem), crafting (economy), weather (weather-and-time), etc.

### Edge Case 2: "My simulation needs to be deterministic"
**Symptom**: Multiplayer, replay system, or deterministic requirement

**Process**:
1. Route to debugging-simulation-chaos EARLY (learn determinism requirements)
2. Then route to implementation skill(s)
3. Implement with determinism constraints from start (cheaper than refactoring)

**Why**: Determinism requirements affect implementation decisions. Better to know early.

### Edge Case 3: "I need simulation but performance is already a concern"
**Symptom**: Performance budget known to be tight from start

**Process**:
1. Route to simulation-vs-faking (aggressive use of faking/LOD)
2. Route to implementation skill(s)
3. Route to performance-optimization-for-sims for architectural guidance
4. Implement with performance in mind from start

**Why**: If performance is constrained, design for performance from the beginning. Don't implement naive version first.

### Edge Case 4: "I'm refactoring existing simulation"
**Symptom**: Working simulation exists but needs improvement

**Process**:
1. If broken: debugging-simulation-chaos first
2. If slow: performance-optimization-for-sims
3. If wrong architecture: simulation-vs-faking to reconsider design, then relevant implementation skill

**Why**: Refactoring is different from greenfield. Identify the problem (bug, performance, design) before routing.

### Edge Case 5: "I need simulation for tool/editor, not game"
**Symptom**: Simulation is for preview/visualization, not runtime gameplay

**Process**:
1. Route to simulation-vs-faking (tools have different constraints than games)
2. Route to implementation skill(s)
3. Optimize for accuracy over performance (tools can be slower)

**Why**: Tool simulations prioritize accuracy and debuggability over frame rate.

## CONCLUSION: The Art of Routing

Effective routing requires understanding:
1. **What each skill provides** (domain coverage)
2. **When to use each skill** (triggers and context)
3. **How skills combine** (workflows and dependencies)
4. **What mistakes to avoid** (anti-patterns)

Master this meta-skill to navigate the simulation-tactics skillpack efficiently. The right routing decision saves hours of wasted work.

**Remember the golden rule**: ALWAYS start with simulation-vs-faking, even when you "know" you need simulation. The 5 minutes spent validating your assumptions prevents the hours spent over-engineering systems that could have been faked.

Now route confidently to the specific skills you need!
