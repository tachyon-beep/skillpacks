# Weather and Time Systems

**When to use this skill**: When implementing day/night cycles, weather systems, seasonal changes, or time-based gameplay mechanics in games. Critical for survival games, open-world games, farming simulators, and any game where time and weather affect gameplay.

**What this skill provides**: Comprehensive understanding of time-of-day systems (sun angle calculation, twilight), dynamic weather (rain, snow, fog), performance-optimized particle systems, gameplay integration patterns, seasonal simulation, time acceleration, and visibility management to maintain 60 FPS while keeping the game playable.

## Core Concepts

### Time of Day Systems

**Solar Angle Calculation**
- **Real-world sun path**: Sun rises in east, peaks at south (northern hemisphere), sets in west
- **Solar elevation angle**: Varies with latitude and season (0° at horizon, 90° at zenith)
- **Azimuth angle**: Horizontal direction (0° = north, 90° = east, 180° = south, 270° = west)
- **Use case**: Realistic sun movement, shadow direction, day length variation

**Twilight Phases**
- **Civil twilight**: Sun 0° to -6° below horizon (still visible light)
- **Nautical twilight**: Sun -6° to -12° below horizon (horizon barely visible)
- **Astronomical twilight**: Sun -12° to -18° below horizon (darkest before true night)
- **Gameplay impact**: Smooth transition from day to night (no jarring darkness)

**Time Acceleration**
- **Real-time**: 1 second game = 1 second real-time (Animal Crossing)
- **Accelerated**: 1 minute game = 1 day in-game (Minecraft: 20 minutes = 24 hours)
- **Player-controlled**: Variable speed (Stardew Valley: speed up while sleeping)
- **Paused time**: Strategic games pause time during combat (XCOM)

### Weather Systems

**Weather Types and Properties**
- **Clear**: High visibility (1000m+), no movement penalty, minimal particles
- **Rain**: Reduced visibility (500m), slight movement penalty, moderate particles
- **Heavy Rain**: Low visibility (200m), movement penalty, high particles
- **Snow**: Moderate visibility (300m), movement penalty, moderate particles
- **Blizzard**: Very low visibility (100m), major movement penalty, high particles
- **Fog**: Very low visibility (50m), no movement penalty, zero particles (post-process)
- **Thunderstorm**: Periodic flashes, audio cues, lightning strikes

**Weather Simulation Models**

**Static Weather**: Pre-scripted weather patterns
- **Use case**: Scripted story moments, performance-critical scenarios
- **Pros**: Predictable, performant, no simulation cost
- **Cons**: Repetitive, not dynamic

**Procedural Weather**: Dynamic simulation based on rules
- **Use case**: Open-world games, long play sessions
- **Pros**: Varied, emergent patterns, replayability
- **Cons**: Can be unpredictable, requires tuning

**Markov Chain Weather**: Probability-based state transitions
- **Method**: Each weather type has transition probabilities to other types
- **Example**: Clear 70% → Clear, 20% → Cloudy, 10% → Rain
- **Pros**: Realistic patterns, controllable, prevents rapid oscillation
- **Cons**: Requires weather state machine

**Seasonal Variation**
- **Spring**: High rain probability, moderate temperatures
- **Summer**: High clear probability, hot temperatures
- **Fall**: Moderate rain, temperature drops
- **Winter**: High snow probability, cold temperatures, shorter days

### Particle System Optimization

**Performance Budgets**
- **Target frame time**: 16.67ms for 60 FPS
- **Particle budget**: 1-2ms per frame (5-10% of frame time)
- **Maximum particles**: 1,000-5,000 depending on platform (PC higher, mobile lower)
- **Particle update cost**: ~0.001ms per particle (CPU), ~0.0002ms (GPU)

**Level of Detail (LOD)**
- **Near camera (0-50m)**: Full particle density, full physics
- **Medium distance (50-200m)**: 50% particle density, simplified physics
- **Far distance (200m+)**: 25% particle density, no physics (billboards)
- **Out of view**: No particles (frustum culling)

**Object Pooling**
- **Problem**: Creating/destroying particles every frame causes GC pressure
- **Solution**: Pre-allocate pool, recycle particles
- **Pool size**: 2× maximum active particles (allows burst without allocation)

**Spatial Culling**
- **Frustum culling**: Don't render particles outside camera view
- **Distance culling**: Don't simulate particles beyond visibility range
- **Occlusion culling**: Don't render particles behind solid objects

### Visibility Management

**Gameplay Visibility vs Atmospheric Realism**
- **Problem**: Realistic night is pitch black (unplayable)
- **Solution**: Minimum ambient light for gameplay (0.15-0.25 even at midnight)
- **Trick**: Blue tint simulates moonlight without true darkness

**Fog Distance Curve**
- **Linear fog**: Visibility fades linearly with distance
- **Exponential fog**: Realistic, visibility drops off exponentially
- **Exponential squared**: Most realistic, dense fog feel
- **Gameplay consideration**: Too much fog frustrates players, balance with gameplay needs

**Dynamic Visibility**
- **Weather-based**: Rain/snow/fog reduce visibility distance
- **Time-based**: Night reduces visibility (but not below minimum)
- **Additive**: Multiple factors combine (night + fog = very limited visibility)

## Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Real-Time vs Accelerated Time

```
START: What type of game am I building?

├─ REAL-TIME EXPERIENCE?
│  ├─ Social/multiplayer game? → Use REAL-TIME CLOCK
│  │  - Animal Crossing: Real-world time = game time
│  │  - MMOs: Synchronized time across players
│  │  - Pros: Shared experience, event scheduling
│  │  - Cons: Players can't skip boring parts
│  │
│  └─ Single-player atmospheric? → Use REAL-TIME with PAUSE
│     - Survival horror: Real-time tension
│     - Flight simulators: Real-time weather
│     - Add pause/fast-forward for player convenience
│
├─ GAMEPLAY PACING REQUIRES FAST TIME?
│  ├─ Farming/crafting mechanics? → Use ACCELERATED TIME
│  │  - Stardew Valley: 1 second real = 1 minute game
│  │  - Minecraft: 20 minutes real = 1 day game
│  │  - Allows crops to grow in reasonable playtime
│  │  - Players experience full day/night in one session
│  │
│  └─ Long-term progression? → Use ACCELERATED with SLEEP
│     - Skip to next day when sleeping
│     - Time passes while player away (mobile games)
│
├─ STRATEGIC/TURN-BASED?
│  └─ Use PAUSED TIME during decisions
│     - XCOM: Time stops during combat turns
│     - Civilization: Discrete turns (day/night cosmetic only)
│     - RTS: Can pause and issue orders
│
└─ PLAYER CHOICE?
   └─ Provide TIME CONTROL UI
      - Speed slider: 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x
      - "Wait" button: Skip to morning/night
      - Strategic layer: Pause/slow/fast
```

**Example Decision**: Survival game with crafting
- **Chosen**: Accelerated time (30 min real = 24 hours game)
- **Reasoning**: Players need full day/night cycle per session, crafting takes minutes not hours
- **Time control**: Let players sleep to skip night, speed up to 3x when safe

### Framework 2: Static vs Dynamic Weather

```
START: How important is weather to my gameplay?

├─ WEATHER IS COSMETIC ONLY?
│  └─ Use STATIC WEATHER with scripted changes
│     - Pre-defined weather for each level/mission
│     - Lighter on performance
│     - Predictable for testing
│     - Example: Linear FPS games (scripted rain in mission 3)
│
├─ WEATHER AFFECTS GAMEPLAY SIGNIFICANTLY?
│  ├─ Short sessions (< 1 hour)? → Use PROCEDURAL with SHORT CYCLE
│  │  - Ensure players experience weather variety
│  │  - Faster transitions (10-15 minute cycles)
│  │  - Example: PUBG (random weather per match)
│  │
│  └─ Long sessions (1+ hours)? → Use PROCEDURAL with REALISTIC CYCLE
│     - Slower transitions (30-60 minute cycles)
│     - Weather affects strategy (take cover in storm)
│     - Example: Zelda BOTW (dynamic weather with gameplay effects)
│
├─ SEASONAL PROGRESSION IMPORTANT?
│  └─ Use SEASONAL SYSTEM with weather probability curves
│     - Spring: 60% rain, 30% clear, 10% cloudy
│     - Summer: 70% clear, 20% cloudy, 10% rain
│     - Fall: 40% clear, 40% cloudy, 20% rain
│     - Winter: 50% snow, 30% clear, 20% overcast
│
└─ MULTIPLAYER SYNCHRONIZATION NEEDED?
   └─ Use SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE weather
      - Server decides weather, clients render
      - All players see same weather
      - Important for competitive games (fair visibility)
```

**Example Decision**: Open-world survival game
- **Chosen**: Dynamic procedural weather with seasonal variation
- **Reasoning**: Long sessions, weather affects gameplay (shelter needed in rain)
- **Implementation**: Markov chain transitions, 45-min average weather duration

### Framework 3: Cosmetic vs Gameplay-Affecting Weather

```
START: Should weather affect gameplay?

├─ WEATHER AS ATMOSPHERE ONLY?
│  └─ Cosmetic effects
│     - Visual particles (rain, snow)
│     - Audio (thunder, wind)
│     - No mechanical effects
│     - Use when: Story-driven games where consistency > variance
│
├─ WEATHER AS MINOR MODIFIER?
│  └─ Subtle gameplay effects
│     - Visibility slightly reduced (800m → 600m)
│     - Movement speed -5% in rain
│     - Audio masking (harder to hear enemies)
│     - Use when: Competitive games (small effects for fairness)
│
├─ WEATHER AS MAJOR MECHANIC?
│  └─ Significant gameplay effects
│     - Visibility heavily reduced (fog: 1000m → 100m)
│     - Movement penalty (snow: -25% speed)
│     - Health effects (hypothermia in blizzard)
│     - Resource requirements (shelter from rain)
│     - Use when: Survival games, tactical advantages
│
└─ WEATHER AS CORE SYSTEM?
   └─ Central gameplay pillar
      - Plan activities around weather
      - Specific gear for weather types
      - Weather-dependent quests
      - Example: Death Stranding (rain damages cargo)
      - Example: Rain World (rain cycle is core mechanic)
```

**Decision Matrix**:
| Game Type | Weather Role | Visibility Impact | Movement Impact | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| Arena FPS | Cosmetic | None | None | Quake |
| Battle Royale | Minor | -20% range | None | PUBG |
| Open-world | Major | -50% in fog | -25% in snow | Zelda BOTW |
| Survival | Core | -70% in blizzard | -40% | The Long Dark |

**Example Decision**: Survival game
- **Chosen**: Weather as major mechanic
- **Effects**: Rain requires shelter, snow reduces movement, fog limits visibility
- **Balance**: Weather gives strategic depth but doesn't feel unfair

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Smooth Time-of-Day System with Solar Math

**Problem**: Hardcoded hour-to-angle mapping looks unnatural. Binary day/night creates jarring transitions.

**Solution**: Calculate sun position using realistic solar math, implement twilight phases.

```python
import math

class TimeOfDaySystem:
    def __init__(self, day_length_seconds=1200, latitude=45.0):
        """
        day_length_seconds: Real-time seconds for full 24-hour cycle

        self.day_of_year = 172  # Day 172 = summer solstice (longest day)
        self.time_scale = 1.0  # Multiplier for acceleration

    def update(self, delta_time):
        """Update time, wrapping at 24 hours"""
        hours_per_second = 24.0 / self.day_length_seconds
        self.current_time += delta_time * hours_per_second * self.time_scale

        if self.current_time >= 24.0:
            self.current_time -= 24.0

        day_angle = 2 * math.pi * (self.day_of_year - 81) / 365
        declination = math.radians(23.44) * math.sin(day_angle)

        # Hour angle: Sun's position relative to solar noon
        # -180° at midnight, 0° at noon, +180° at next midnight
        hour_angle = math.radians(15.0 * (self.current_time - 12.0))

        # Solar elevation angle (altitude)
        sin_elevation = (math.sin(self.latitude_rad) * math.sin(declination) +
                        math.cos(self.latitude_rad) * math.cos(declination) *
                        math.cos(hour_angle))
        elevation = math.asin(max(-1, min(1, sin_elevation)))

        # Solar azimuth angle
        cos_azimuth = ((math.sin(declination) -
                       math.sin(self.latitude_rad) * sin_elevation) /
                      (math.cos(self.latitude_rad) * math.cos(elevation)))
        cos_azimuth = max(-1, min(1, cos_azimuth))
        azimuth = math.acos(cos_azimuth)

        # Correct azimuth for afternoon (hour angle > 0)
        if hour_angle > 0:
            azimuth = 2 * math.pi - azimuth

        return math.degrees(elevation), math.degrees(azimuth)

    def get_ambient_light_factor(self):
        """Calculate ambient light with twilight transitions"""
        elevation, _ = self.get_sun_position()

        if elevation > 0:
            # Daytime: Full light
            return 1.0
        elif elevation > -6:
            # Civil twilight: Smooth transition
            t = (elevation + 6) / 6  # 0 to 1
            return 0.25 + (0.75 * t)  # 0.25 to 1.0
        elif elevation > -12:
            # Nautical twilight
            t = (elevation + 12) / 6
            return 0.15 + (0.10 * t)  # 0.15 to 0.25
        else:
            # Night: Minimum light for gameplay
            return 0.15  # Never truly black (moonlight simulation)

    def get_sun_color(self):
        """Calculate sun color based on elevation"""
        elevation, _ = self.get_sun_position()

        if elevation > 30:
            # High sun: White

        """Instantly jump to specific time (for 'wait' or 'sleep' actions)"""
        self.current_time = target_hour % 24.0
```

**Benefits**:
- Realistic sun movement (rises east, sets west)
- Smooth twilight transitions (no jarring darkness)
- Day length varies with season (longer summer days)
- Minimum ambient light (0.15) keeps game playable at night
- Configurable latitude and day length

**When to use**:
- Open-world games with visual realism
- Games where sun position matters (shadows, solar panels)
- Long play sessions where players experience full day

**Real-world example**: Red Dead Redemption 2 uses accurate solar calculations for realistic lighting throughout the day.

### Pattern 2: Budget-Constrained Particle System with LOD

**Problem**: Naive particle systems spawn unlimited particles, causing FPS death.

**Solution**: Enforce hard particle limit, use LOD based on distance, pool objects.

```python
import random
from collections import deque

class Particle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0.0
        self.y = 0.0
        self.z = 0.0
        self.vx = 0.0
        self.vy = 0.0
        self.vz = 0.0
        self.lifetime = 0.0
        self.max_lifetime = 1.0
        self.active = False

class WeatherParticleSystem:
    def __init__(self, max_particles=5000):
        self.max_particles = max_particles

        # Pre-allocate particle pool (NO allocations during gameplay)
        self.particle_pool = [Particle() for _ in range(max_particles)]
        self.active_particles = []
        self.free_particles = deque(self.particle_pool)

        self.lod_near = 50.0  # Full density
        self.lod_medium = 150.0  # 50% density
        self.lod_far = 300.0  # 25% density

        # Performance tracking
        self.time_budget_ms = 2.0  # Max 2ms per frame
        self.spawn_this_frame = 0

    def spawn_rain(self, camera_pos, intensity, delta_time):
        """Spawn rain particles with LOD and budget constraints"""
        # Calculate spawn budget based on frame time
        base_spawn_rate = intensity * 1000  # Particles per second
        desired_spawn = int(base_spawn_rate * delta_time)

        # LOD: Reduce spawn in layers by distance
        near_spawn = desired_spawn  # Full density near camera
        medium_spawn = desired_spawn // 2  # 50% at medium distance
        far_spawn = desired_spawn // 4  # 25% at far distance

        # Enforce particle cap
        available_slots = self.max_particles - len(self.active_particles)
        total_spawn = min(near_spawn + medium_spawn + far_spawn, available_slots)

        if total_spawn == 0:
            return  # At capacity or no budget

        spawned = 0

        # Spawn near particles (0-50m)
        for _ in range(min(near_spawn, available_slots)):
            if not self.free_particles:

            particle = self.free_particles.popleft()
            self._initialize_rain_particle(particle, camera_pos, self.lod_near)
            self.active_particles.append(particle)
            spawned += 1

            self.active_particles.append(particle)
            spawned += 1

        # Spawn far particles (150-300m) - only if budget allows
        remaining_budget = available_slots - spawned
        for _ in range(min(far_spawn, remaining_budget)):
            if not self.free_particles:
                break

            particle = self.free_particles.popleft()
            self._initialize_rain_particle(particle, camera_pos, self.lod_far,
                                          offset_min=self.lod_medium)
            self.active_particles.append(particle)

    def _initialize_rain_particle(self, particle, camera_pos, max_distance,
                                  offset_min=0.0):
        """Initialize a rain particle at random position"""

        distance = random.uniform(offset_min, max_distance)

        particle.x = camera_pos[0] + distance * math.cos(angle)
        particle.z = camera_pos[2] + distance * math.sin(angle)
        particle.y = camera_pos[1] + random.uniform(30, 50)  # High in sky

        # Rain falls straight down with slight wind
        particle.vx = random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5)
        particle.vy = -10.0  # Fall speed
        particle.vz = random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5)

        particle.lifetime = 0.0
        particle.max_lifetime = random.uniform(3.0, 5.0)
        particle.active = True

    def update(self, delta_time, camera_pos):
        """Update all active particles with time budget"""
        import time
        start_time = time.perf_counter()

        particles_to_remove = []

        for particle in self.active_particles:
            # Update position
            particle.x += particle.vx * delta_time
            particle.y += particle.vy * delta_time
            particle.z += particle.vz * delta_time

            particle.lifetime += delta_time

            # Remove if below ground or lifetime expired
            if particle.y < 0 or particle.lifetime > particle.max_lifetime:
                particle.active = False
                particles_to_remove.append(particle)
                continue

            # Distance culling: Remove particles far from camera
            dx = particle.x - camera_pos[0]
            dz = particle.z - camera_pos[2]
            dist_sq = dx*dx + dz*dz

            if dist_sq > self.lod_far * self.lod_far:
                particle.active = False
                particles_to_remove.append(particle)

            # Budget check: Stop updating if over time budget
            elapsed_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1000
            if elapsed_ms > self.time_budget_ms:
                break  # Update remaining particles next frame

        # Return particles to pool

            self.active_particles.remove(particle)
            self.free_particles.append(particle)

    def get_particle_count(self):
        return len(self.active_particles)
```

**Benefits**:
- Hard cap on particles (5,000 max) prevents unbounded growth
- Object pooling eliminates GC pressure (zero allocations during gameplay)
- LOD reduces particles by distance (75% at 300m)
- Time budget prevents frame time spikes (stops at 2ms)
- Distance culling removes particles outside range

**Performance**:
- CPU cost: ~1-2ms per frame (5000 particles)
- Memory: Fixed (pre-allocated pool)
- FPS: Stable 60 FPS

**When to use**:
- Any game with weather particles (rain, snow)
- Performance-critical scenarios (mobile, VR)
- Large open worlds (distance culling essential)

**Real-world example**: Zelda BOTW limits rain particles to ~3,000, uses heavy LOD culling beyond 100m.

### Pattern 3: Gameplay-Integrated Weather System

**Problem**: Weather is cosmetic-only, doesn't affect player strategy or tactics.

**Solution**: Weather modifies visibility, movement, audio, and environmental hazards.

```python
from enum import Enum
from dataclasses import dataclass

class WeatherType(Enum):

**Benefits**:
- Weather directly affects gameplay (movement, visibility, audio)
- Smooth transitions prevent jarring changes
- Easy to balance (modify property values)
- AI can react to weather (seek shelter, change tactics)

**Gameplay Applications**:
- **Stealth**: Use rain to mask footsteps, fog to avoid detection
- **Combat**: Heavy rain reduces visibility, favors close-range
- **Survival**: Blizzard forces player to find shelter (hypothermia risk)
- **Strategy**: Plan attacks during favorable weather

**When to use**:
- Survival games (weather is hazard)
- Stealth games (weather affects detection)
- Open-world games (weather adds variety)

**Real-world example**: Metal Gear Solid V uses rain to mask noise, sandstorms to reduce visibility.

### Pattern 4: Markov Chain Weather Transitions with Seasonal Variation

**Problem**: Completely random weather feels unnatural and lacks patterns.

**Solution**: Use Markov chain with season-dependent transition probabilities.

```python
import random

class Season(Enum):
    SPRING = 0
    SUMMER = 1
    FALL = 2
    WINTER = 3

class WeatherSimulation:

        self.time_in_current_weather = 0.0
        self.min_weather_duration = 300.0  # 5 minutes minimum

        # Transition probability matrices (current → next)
        # Rows: current weather, Columns: next weather
        # Order: CLEAR, CLOUDY, RAIN, HEAVY_RAIN, SNOW, BLIZZARD, FOG

        self.transition_probabilities = {
            Season.SPRING: {
                WeatherType.CLEAR: [0.4, 0.4, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],

            },
        }

        ]

    def update(self, delta_time):
        """Update weather simulation"""
        self.time_in_current_weather += delta_time

        # Only consider transition after minimum duration
        if self.time_in_current_weather < self.min_weather_duration:
            return

        # Check for transition (1% chance per second after minimum)

    def _transition_weather(self):
        """Choose next weather based on Markov chain"""
        season_probs = self.transition_probabilities[self.current_season]

        if self.current_weather not in season_probs:
            # Current weather not valid for season, force to CLEAR
            self.current_weather = WeatherType.CLEAR
            return

        probabilities = season_probs[self.current_weather]

        # Weighted random choice
        rand_val = random.random()
        cumulative = 0.0

        for i, prob in enumerate(probabilities):
            cumulative += prob

```

**Benefits**:
- Natural weather patterns (not purely random)
- Seasonal variation (snow in winter, not summer)
- Prevents rapid oscillation (minimum duration)
- Controllable probabilities (easy to tune)

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- **Spring**: Rainy (60% chance), moderate temperatures
- **Summer**: Clear and hot (70% clear), occasional thunderstorms
- **Fall**: Cloudy and foggy, transition to cold
- **Winter**: Snow and blizzards (40% snow), cold

**When to use**:
- Open-world games with seasons
- Long play sessions (players notice patterns)
- Realistic simulation games

**Real-world example**: Animal Crossing uses Markov-like weather with seasonal variation.

### Pattern 5: Time Control UI and "Wait" Mechanic

**Problem**: Players forced to wait through boring periods (night, storms).

**Solution**: Provide time acceleration controls and "wait until" actions.

```python
class TimeControlSystem:
    def __init__(self, time_of_day_system, weather_system):

**Benefits**:
- Players skip boring periods (night, waiting for shop to open)
- Strategic use (wait for enemies to leave area)
- Performance optimization (faster time = fewer frames to render)
- Quality-of-life feature (respects player's time)

**Design Considerations**:
- Only allow waiting in safe locations (no combat exploit)
- Restore energy/health during wait (reward for using feature)
- Fast-forward at 60x speed (visible but quick)
- Stop if interrupted (enemy appears)

**When to use**:
- Games with day/night cycles
- Survival games (wait for weather to clear)
- RPGs (wait for shops to open)

**Real-world examples**:
- Skyrim: "Wait" menu to skip time
- Stardew Valley: Sleep to skip to next day
- Zelda BOTW: Campfire rest to skip to morning/night

### Pattern 6: Fog as Post-Process Effect (Zero Particles)

```

**Benefits**:
- Zero particles (massive performance win)
- Better visual quality (smooth falloff)
- Easy to control (density, color, distance)
- Works with any weather

**When to use**:
- Fog weather type
- Distance-based visibility reduction
- Atmospheric depth cues

**Real-world example**: Nearly all modern games use post-process fog, not particle-based.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Performance Death - Unbounded Particle Growth

**Symptom**: FPS drops from 60 to single digits after a few minutes of rain.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# WRONG: No particle limit
for _ in range(1000):  # Spawn 1000 per frame!
    particles.append(RainParticle())
# After 60 frames: 60,000 particles → 1 FPS
```

**Why it happens**: Developers test for a few seconds, don't notice particles accumulating.

**Fix**: Hard particle cap + object pooling
```python
# RIGHT: Enforce maximum
MAX_PARTICLES = 5000

if len(active_particles) < MAX_PARTICLES:
    particle = particle_pool.get()  # Reuse from pool
    active_particles.append(particle)
```

**Testing**: Run game for 5+ minutes with heavy rain, monitor particle count.

### Pitfall 2: Night Too Dark - Unplayable Visibility

**Symptom**: Players complain they can't see anything at night, quit game.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# WRONG: Realistic night (pitch black)
if is_night():
    ambient_light = 0.0  # Can't see ANYTHING
```

**Why it happens**: Developers prioritize realism over playability.

**Fix**: Minimum ambient light for gameplay
```python
# RIGHT: "Moonlight" minimum
if is_night():
    ambient_light = 0.15  # Dim but playable
    # Add blue tint to simulate moonlight
    ambient_color = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)
```

**Balance**: Night should feel atmospheric, not frustrating.

**Alternative**: Provide torch/lantern that player must manage (fuel, battery).

### Pitfall 3: Weather Too Random - No Predictability

**Symptom**: Snow in summer, instant weather changes, feels chaotic.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# WRONG: Completely random
weather = random.choice(['clear', 'rain', 'snow', 'fog'])
# Can jump from clear to blizzard instantly!
```

**Why it happens**: Randomness is easy to implement, patterns require system design.

**Fix**: Use Markov chain with seasonal constraints
```python
# RIGHT: Pattern-based transitions
next_weather = markov_chain.transition(current_weather, current_season)
# Clear → Cloudy → Rain (gradual)
# No snow in summer (seasonal rules)
```

**Result**: Weather feels natural, players can anticipate changes.

### Pitfall 4: Instant Weather Changes - Jarring Transitions

**Symptom**: Weather switches instantly (clear → downpour in 1 frame).

**Root Cause**:
```python
# WRONG: Instant switch
if should_change_weather():
    weather = new_weather  # Instant!
```

**Fix**: Smooth transition over time
```python
# RIGHT: 5-second transition
if transitioning:
    t += delta_time / transition_duration  # 0 to 1
    intensity = lerp(old_intensity, new_intensity, t)
```

**Transition duration**:
- Clear → Cloudy: 10 seconds
- Cloudy → Rain: 5 seconds
- Rain → Clear: 15 seconds (gradual clearing)

### Pitfall 5: Particle Update Cost - No Culling

**Symptom**: Particles far from camera still tank FPS.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# WRONG: Update ALL particles
for particle in all_particles:
    particle.update()  # Even if 500m away!
```

**Fix**: Distance-based culling
```python
# RIGHT: Only update visible particles
for particle in all_particles:
    if distance(particle, camera) < fog_distance:
        particle.update()
    else:
        # Cull distant particles
        particle_pool.return(particle)
```

**Savings**: 50-70% of particle update cost.

### Pitfall 6: No LOD - Same Density Everywhere

**Symptom**: Performance poor even with particle cap.

**Root Cause**: Same particle density near and far.

**Fix**: LOD-based spawn
```python
# RIGHT: Reduce density with distance
if distance < 50:
    spawn_count = 100  # Full density
elif distance < 150:
    spawn_count = 50  # 50% density
elif distance < 300:
    spawn_count = 25  # 25% density
```

**Result**: 2-3× better performance with same visual quality.

### Pitfall 7: No Time Budget - Frame Spikes

**Symptom**: Occasional frame drops (60 → 40 FPS) when spawning particles.

**Root Cause**: Particle system takes too long some frames.

**Fix**: Time budget with early exit
```python
# RIGHT: Enforce budget
start = time.perf_counter()
for particle in particles:
    particle.update()
    if (time.perf_counter() - start) > 0.002:  # 2ms budget
        break  # Continue next frame
```

**Result**: Consistent frame pacing.

### Pitfall 8: GC Pressure - Creating Objects Every Frame

**Symptom**: Micro-stuttering, frame time spikes every few seconds.

**Root Cause**: Garbage collector running constantly.

**Fix**: Object pooling
```python
# WRONG: New objects every frame
particle = RainParticle()

# RIGHT: Reuse from pool
particle = particle_pool.get_or_create()
```

**Impact**: Eliminates GC spikes.

### Pitfall 9: No Gameplay Integration - Cosmetic Only

**Symptom**: Weather looks nice but doesn't matter strategically.

**Root Cause**: Weather is just visual, no mechanical effects.

**Fix**: Weather modifies gameplay
```python
# RIGHT: Weather affects mechanics
player.movement_speed *= weather.get_movement_modifier()
enemy_detection_range *= weather.get_visibility_modifier()
footstep_audio_range *= (1 - weather.get_audio_masking())
```

**Result**: Weather becomes tactical consideration.

### Pitfall 10: No Seasonal System - Snow in Summer

**Symptom**: Immersion broken by incorrect weather for season.

**Root Cause**: Weather independent of season.

**Fix**: Seasonal probability curves
```python
# RIGHT: Season determines weather chances
if season == SUMMER:
    weather_chances = {'clear': 0.7, 'rain': 0.3, 'snow': 0.0}
elif season == WINTER:
    weather_chances = {'clear': 0.3, 'rain': 0.0, 'snow': 0.7}
```
