# Player-Driven Narratives

## When to Use This Skill

Use when you need game systems to generate compelling stories through emergence:
- Building sandbox games where players create their own narratives
- Implementing AI storytellers that pace dramatic events
- Designing simulation systems that produce memorable moments
- Creating persistent worlds with evolving histories
- Developing character relationship systems that drive drama

**Indicators you need this**: Your simulation runs but produces no memorable stories, events feel random rather than dramatic, players can't recall what happened, or you're writing thousands of scripted events instead of building narrative-generating systems.

## Before You Begin

### RED Phase: Identifying Narrative Failures

Let's build a colony simulator WITHOUT proper narrative systems to document what goes wrong.

#### Test Scenario: "Build sandbox game with emergent storytelling"

We'll create a basic colony sim and measure its narrative engagement.

```python
# RED BASELINE: Colony simulator without narrative systems
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List

@dataclass
class Colonist:
    name: str
    health: int = 100
    hunger: int = 0

class Colony:
    def __init__(self):
        self.colonists = [
            Colonist("Person1"),
            Colonist("Person2"),
            Colonist("Person3")
        ]
        self.day = 0

    def simulate_day(self):
        self.day += 1
        for colonist in self.colonists:
            # Basic survival mechanics
            colonist.hunger += random.randint(5, 15)
            if colonist.hunger > 100:
                colonist.health -= 10

            # Random events
            if random.random() < 0.1:
                colonist.health -= random.randint(10, 30)

    def run_simulation(self, days: int):
        for _ in range(days):
            self.simulate_day()

# Test narrative engagement
colony = Colony()
print("=== Colony Simulation ===")
for i in range(10):
    colony.simulate_day()
    print(f"Day {colony.day}: Colonists exist")

print("\nCan you remember anything that happened?")
print("Were there any memorable moments?")
print("Did any stories emerge?")
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Day 1: Colonists exist
Day 2: Colonists exist
Day 3: Colonists exist
...
```

#### Documented RED Failures

Running this baseline reveals **12 critical narrative failures**:

**1. BLAND SIMULATION SYNDROME**
- Systems run but nothing feels significant
- Numbers change but no meaning emerges
- Example: Health drops from 100 to 90... so what?
```python
# What we see:
"Colonist health: 90"

# What we need:
"Marcus limps back from the mine, clutching his bleeding arm"
```

**2. NO EMOTIONAL VARIETY**
- All events feel identical
- No tonal range (comedy, tragedy, triumph)
- Missing: Surprising reversals, lucky breaks, crushing defeats
```python
# Current: Everything is neutral
event = random.choice(["thing1", "thing2", "thing3"])

# Need: Emotional spectrum
event_with_weight = {
    'type': 'betrayal',
    'emotion': 'shock',
    'magnitude': 'relationship-ending'
}
```

**3. ZERO EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT**
- "Person1" vs "Marcus the carpenter who saved three lives"
- No history, relationships, or personality
- Players don't care who lives or dies
```python
# Current: Just a name
colonist = Colonist("Person1")

# Need: A person with history
"""
Marcus, age 34, carpenter
- Saved two colonists during the fire
- Has feud with Sarah over food rationing
- Married to Elena, father of two
- Drinks too much since his brother died
"""
```

**4. NO PERSISTENCE (GOLDFISH MEMORY)**
- Each event exists in isolation
- Past actions don't matter
- No grudges, debts, or legacy
```python
# Current: No memory
if random.random() < 0.1:
    damage_colonist()  # Forgotten next tick

# Need: Persistent consequences
"""
Day 15: Marcus insulted Sarah in public
Day 47: Sarah refuses to help Marcus in fire
Day 120: Marcus dies; Sarah feels guilty for years
"""
```

**5. NO SHARED NARRATIVE TOOLS**
- Can't retell stories to others
- No chronicle or legend system
- Stories die when you close the game
```python
# Current: Nothing to share
# (game closes, story lost forever)

# Need: Exportable stories
"""
THE LEGEND OF IRON HEART COLONY

Year 1: The Founding (5 survivors)
Year 2: The Great Fire (Marcus's sacrifice)
Year 3: The Betrayal (Sarah's revenge)
Most notable deaths: Marcus (hero), Elena (grief)
"""
```

**6. EVENTS HAVE NO WEIGHT**
- "Colonist died" = just a number change
- Missing: Context, consequences, reactions
```python
# Current: Dry announcement
"Colonist health reduced to 0"

# Need: Dramatic weight
"""
Marcus collapsed in the burning workshop, tools still
in hand. Elena's scream echoed through the colony.
The children ask about him every day. Sarah hasn't
spoken since. The unfinished chapel stands as his monument.
"""
```

**7. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT**
- Static personalities
- No growth, no arcs, no transformation
- Same person day 1 as day 1000
```python
# Current: Forever static
colonist.trait = "brave"  # Never changes

# Need: Dynamic arcs
"""
Marcus: Cowardly → (fire event) → Found courage →
        Became hero → (guilt) → Reckless → Sacrificed self
"""
```

**8. ISOLATED MECHANICS (NO INTERACTION)**
- Hunger system, health system, mood system... all separate
- No cascading drama
- Missing: "I was hungry, so I stole, so I got caught, so I was exiled"
```python
# Current: Separate systems
hunger += 10
health -= 5
# No connection!

# Need: Cascading drama
"""
Hunger (desperate) → Steal food → Caught by Sarah →
Trial → Exile vote → Marcus defends → Splits colony →
Formation of two factions → Cold war → ...
"""
```

**9. NO NARRATIVE ARC**
- Random events forever
- No rising tension, climax, resolution
- Just... stuff happening
```python
# Current: Flat randomness
while True:
    random_event()  # Forever

# Need: Dramatic structure
"""
Act 1: Peaceful founding (establish baseline)
Act 2: Tensions rise (food shortage, relationships strain)
Act 3: Crisis (fire/raid/plague)
Act 4: Resolution (rebuild or collapse)
Act 5: New equilibrium (changed colony)
"""
```

**10. UNMEMORABLE (NO HIGHLIGHTS)**
- Everything blends together
- Can't recall specific moments
- No "peak moments" to anchor memory
```python
# Current: 1000 identical days
for day in range(1000):
    boring_stuff()

# Need: Memorable peaks
"""
Days 1-30: Normal
Day 31: THE FIRE (everyone remembers this)
Days 32-90: Aftermath
Day 91: THE BETRAYAL (defining moment)
...
"""
```

**11. NO PLAYER AGENCY IN NARRATIVE**
- Player watches but doesn't shape story
- Decisions don't create dramatic branches
- Missing: "Because I chose X, Y happened"
```python
# Current: Passive observation
simulate()  # Player just watches

# Need: Consequential choices
"""
> Should we exile the thief?
  [Exile] → Marcus leaves → Sarah leads → Strict colony
  [Forgive] → Colony splits → Faction war → Chaos
"""
```

**12. SYSTEMS DON'T EXPLAIN THEMSELVES**
- Why did this happen?
- No clear cause/effect for players
- Can't learn "how to create good stories"
```python
# Current: Opaque
colonist.mood = -50  # Why? Unknown!

# Need: Transparent causation
"""
Marcus mood: -50
Causes:
  -20: Wife died last week
  -15: Hates his rival (Sarah)
  -10: Hungry for 3 days
  -5: Uncomfortable sleeping conditions
"""
```

#### Baseline Measurement

**Engagement Score: 0/10**

- ❌ Can't recall any specific events after 10 minutes
- ❌ Don't care about any characters
- ❌ No stories to share with friends
- ❌ Feels like watching numbers change
- ❌ Close game and immediately forget everything

**Why It Fails**: We built a simulation, not a story generator. The systems track state but create no meaning, no drama, no memorable moments.

---

## GREEN Phase: Building Narrative-Generating Systems

Now let's fix every failure by building systems that CREATE stories.

### Core Concept: The Narrative Loop

The fundamental difference between simulation and story:

```
SIMULATION LOOP:
State → Rules → New State → Repeat
(Tracks what IS)

NARRATIVE LOOP:
State → Rules → Event → Interpretation → Story → New State → Repeat
(Creates MEANING)
```

**The key insight**: Add layers that transform dry simulation into meaningful narrative.

### Architecture: Four Layers of Narrative

Magnitude: ★★★★★★★★

Their feud began when Viktor Reeve stole from Elena Hart.

Today it came to a head. Viktor Reeve and Elena Hart had
a vicious argument in front of the entire colony. Insults
were hurled, old wounds reopened. The colony held its breath,
wondering if it would come to blows.

Viktor Reeve challenged Elena Hart to a duel.

Participants: Viktor Reeve, Elena Hart

Consequences:
  • Viktor Reeve and Elena Hart are now bitter enemies
  • Colony is divided into factions
  • Violence seems inevitable
============================================================

🎭 CHARACTER ARC UPDATE: Viktor Reeve is learning the cost
of his cruelty. His redemption arc progresses: 40%

## Decision Framework: When to Use Emergent Narrative

### Use Emergent/Systemic Narrative When:

✅ **Your game is a sandbox**
- Player creates their own goals
- No predetermined story path
- Examples: Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Kenshi

✅ **Replayability is core to your design**
- Each playthrough should feel unique
- Players want "their story"
- Examples: Crusader Kings, The Sims

✅ **Multiplayer with player politics**
- Players ARE the story
- Player interactions drive drama
- Examples: EVE Online, Rust, DayZ

✅ **Simulation depth is a selling point**
- "Living world" is the feature
- Systemic interactions fascinate players
- Examples: Dwarf Fortress, Caves of Qud

✅ **Long-term persistent worlds**
- History accumulates
- Past actions matter years later
- Examples: MMOs, persistent servers

### Use Scripted/Authored Narrative When:

❌ **You have a specific story to tell**
- Author has vision that must be experienced
- Emotional beats need precise control
- Examples: The Last of Us, God of War

❌ **Short, focused experience**
- 8-12 hour games
- Every minute must count
- No time for emergence to develop

❌ **Cinematic presentation is core**
- Directed camera, voice acting, mocap
- Visual storytelling requires control
- Examples: Uncharted, Half-Life

❌ **Thematic depth requires authorship**
- Complex themes need careful handling
- Emergence might trivialize serious topics
- Examples: Spec Ops: The Line, What Remains of Edith Finch

### Hybrid Approach (Best of Both):

🔀 **Scripted backbone + Emergent flesh**
- Main questline is authored
- Side activities are emergent
- Example: Skyrim (scripted quests + radiant AI + emergent crime/economy)

🔀 **Authored events + Systemic responses**
- Story beats are scripted
- How they play out is emergent
- Example: Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (nemesis system)

🔀 **Emergent drama + Authored setpieces**
- Day-to-day is systemic
- Climactic moments are scripted
- Example: State of Decay (random survival + authored story missions)

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes

### Pitfall 1: "Nothing Memorable Happens"

**Symptom**: Simulation runs for hours but player can't recall specific moments.

**Cause**: All events have equal weight. No peaks and valleys.

**Fix**: Implement magnitude system and peak detection.

```python
class MemorabilitySy stem:
    """Ensure memorable moments stand out"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.event_history: List[NarrativeEvent] = []
        self.memorable_threshold = 7  # Magnitude 7+ is memorable

    def record_event(self, event: NarrativeEvent):
        """Record and highlight memorable events"""
        self.event_history.append(event)

        if event.magnitude >= self.memorable_threshold:
            # This is a peak moment - make it REALLY stand out
            self._create_lasting_impression(event)

    def _create_lasting_impression(self, event: NarrativeEvent):
        """Make event unforgettable"""

        # 1. Give it a memorable title
        if not event.title:
            event.title = self._generate_legendary_title(event)

        # 2. Create lasting consequences (tags on characters/world)
        for participant_id in event.participants:
            # This event becomes part of their identity
            # "Marcus the Betrayer" or "Sarah the Savior"
            pass

        # 3. Visual/audio feedback (in full game)
        print(f"\n🌟 LEGENDARY MOMENT: {event.title} 🌟\n")

        # 4. Add to "greatest hits" reel
        # This event will be highlighted in recap/chronicle

    def get_memorable_moments(self) -> List[NarrativeEvent]:
        """Return only the peak moments"""
        return [e for e in self.event_history if e.magnitude >= self.memorable_threshold]
```

### Pitfall 2: "I Don't Care About These Characters"

**Symptom**: Characters die and player feels nothing.

**Cause**: No investment. Characters are just stats.

**Fix**: Build relationships before testing them.

```python
class InvestmentBuilder:
    """Create emotional investment in characters"""

    def build_investment_before_drama(self, character: Character, days: int):
        """Spend time establishing character before putting them at risk"""

        # WRONG: Introduce character and kill them same day
        # RIGHT: Let player spend time with them first

        establishment_events = [
            f"Day 1: Meet {character.name}, learn their dreams",
            f"Day 5: {character.name} shares funny story, player laughs",
            f"Day 10: {character.name} gives player gift, small kindness",
            f"Day 15: {character.name} asks player for advice, shows vulnerability",
            f"Day 20: {character.name} saves player's life, debt formed",
        ]

        # ONLY AFTER establishment can you create meaningful drama:
        # Day 21: {character.name} is in danger!
        # Player: "Not {name}! I care about them!"

        return establishment_events

    def create_attachment_moments(self, character: Character):
        """Small moments that build connection"""

        moments = [
            # Vulnerability
            f"{character.name} admits they're afraid",

            # Humor
            f"{character.name} tells a terrible joke and everyone groans",

            # Kindness
            f"{character.name} comforts a child",

            # Competence
            f"{character.name} solves problem elegantly",

            # Shared experience
            f"You and {character.name} watch the sunset together",
        ]

        # Attachment comes from TIME + INTERACTION + VULNERABILITY
```

### Pitfall 3: "Everything Feels Random"

**Symptom**: No causality. Things just happen.

**Cause**: Events don't build on each other.

**Fix**: Explicit cause-and-effect chains.

```python
class CausalityTracker:
    """Track and communicate cause-and-effect"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.causality_graph: Dict[str, List[str]] = defaultdict(list)

    def record_causation(self, cause_event_id: str, effect_event_id: str):
        """Link cause to effect"""
        self.causality_graph[cause_event_id].append(effect_event_id)

    def explain_event(self, event: NarrativeEvent) -> str:
        """Explain WHY this event happened"""

        # Find causes
        causes = []
        for cause_id, effects in self.causality_graph.items():
            if event.title in effects:
                causes.append(cause_id)

        if causes:
            explanation = f"This happened BECAUSE:\n"
            for cause in causes:
                explanation += f"  → {cause}\n"
            explanation += f"\nWhich LED TO:\n  → {event.title}"
            return explanation
        else:
            return f"{event.title} (no clear cause - random event)"

    def demonstrate_clear_causality(self):
        """Example of good causality communication"""

        # WRONG:
        print("Day 10: Fire happened")
        print("Day 15: Marcus died")
        # Player: "Why? What's the connection?"

        # RIGHT:
        print("""
Day 10: Fire broke out in workshop
  → Cause: Overworked, safety neglected

Day 11: Marcus rushed into burning building
  → Cause: Heard child screaming inside

Day 11: Marcus saved child but was badly burned
  → Cause: Heroic rescue, ceiling collapsed

Day 15: Marcus died from burn injuries
  → Cause: Wounds infected, no antibiotics

Day 16: Colony mourns Marcus
  → Cause: Hero's death

Day 20: Child Marcus saved dedicates life to medicine
  → Cause: Guilt and gratitude from Marcus's sacrifice

        ← Clear chain of causality! Player understands story.
        """)
```

### Pitfall 4: "Stories Don't Stick"

**Symptom**: Close game, forget everything.

**Cause**: No persistence or retelling mechanism.

**Fix**: Build sharing and persistence tools.

```python
class StoryPersistence:
    """Make stories last beyond the session"""

    def create_shareable_story(self, events: List[NarrativeEvent]) -> str:
        """Generate story players WANT to share"""

        # Find the narrative spine
        peak_moments = sorted([e for e in events if e.magnitude >= 7],
                             key=lambda e: e.day)

        if not peak_moments:
            return "Nothing remarkable happened."

        # Format as engaging narrative
        story = f"""
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          MY STORY (share this!)                             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

The tale begins...

"""

        for i, event in enumerate(peak_moments, 1):
            story += f"{i}. {event.title} (Day {event.day})\n"
            story += f"   {event.description[:100]}...\n\n"

        story += "\n[Generated by My Game - Share your story!]"

        return story

    def generate_social_media_summary(self, events: List[NarrativeEvent]) -> str:
        """Create tweet-length summary"""

        best_moment = max(events, key=lambda e: e.magnitude)

        return f"""
Just played an INSANE session!

{best_moment.title}: {best_moment.description[:100]}...

This game writes itself! #MyGame #EmergentStories
"""

    def export_for_youtube_recap(self, events: List[NarrativeEvent]) -> List[Dict]:
        """Structure for video creation"""

        return [
            {
                'timestamp': event.day,
                'title': event.title,
                'description': event.description,
                'emotional_tone': event.emotional_tone.value,
                'suggested_music': self._suggest_music(event.emotional_tone),
                'suggested_visuals': self._suggest_visuals(event)
            }
            for event in sorted(events, key=lambda e: e.magnitude, reverse=True)[:10]
        ]
```

### Pitfall 5: "Too Much Chaos"

**Symptom**: Everything is so random it's meaningless.

**Cause**: No pacing, no structure.

**Fix**: AI storyteller with dramatic pacing.

```python
def fix_chaos_with_pacing():
    """Demonstrate how pacing fixes chaos"""

    print("WRONG: Pure randomness")
    print("=" * 50)
    for day in range(30):
        if random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance daily
            print(f"Day {day}: Random huge event!")
    print("Result: Exhausting, meaningless")

    print("\n\nRIGHT: Structured pacing")
    print("=" * 50)

    # Establishment: 10 quiet days
    print("Days 1-10: Building colony, meeting characters")
    print("            (No major events, establish baseline)")

    # Rising tension: Increasing frequency
    print("\nDays 11-20: Minor challenges")
    print("  Day 12: Small problem (magnitude 3)")
    print("  Day 17: Medium problem (magnitude 5)")

    # Climax: Major event
    print("\nDay 25: CLIMAX - Major disaster! (magnitude 10)")
    print("         Everything player cares about at risk!")

    # Falling action: Deal with consequences
    print("\nDays 26-35: Aftermath")
    print("  Day 27: Mourning the dead")
    print("  Day 30: Rebuilding begins")

    # Resolution: New normal
    print("\nDays 36-45: Resolution")
    print("  Colony changed but stable")
    print("  Ready for next arc")

    print("\nResult: Meaningful, memorable, dramatic!")
```

### Pitfall 6: "Simulation Realism vs Drama"

**Symptom**: Realistic simulation is boring.

**Cause**: Reality is mundane. Drama requires conflict.

**Fix**: Compress time, amplify drama, heighten stakes.

```python
class DramaAmplifier:
    """Make simulation dramatic without breaking realism"""

    def amplify_drama(self, realistic_event: Dict) -> NarrativeEvent:
        """Transform realistic but boring into dramatic and interesting"""

        # Realistic: "Food supplies decreased by 2%"
        # Dramatic: "We're rationing food. Children go hungry."

        if realistic_event['type'] == 'food_decrease':
            # Compress and heighten
            if realistic_event['amount'] < 0.05:  # Tiny decrease
                # Normally ignorable, but we can find the drama:

                return NarrativeEvent(
                    event_type=EventType.CONFLICT,
                    day=realistic_event['day'],
                    title="Rationing Tensions",
                    description="""
The food stores are running low. Rations were cut today.

""",
                    participants=['viktor', 'elena'],

## REFACTOR Phase: Pressure Testing

Let's test the complete system with demanding scenarios.

### Pressure Test 1: Dwarf Fortress Colony (20 dwarves, 5 years)

```python
def pressure_test_dwarf_fortress_scale():
    """Test with DF-scale complexity"""

    print("\n" + "=" * 70)
    print("PRESSURE TEST 1: Dwarf Fortress Scale")
    print("20 dwarves, 1825 days (5 years)")
    print("=" * 70)

    # Create larger colony
    sim = NarrativeColonySimulator(
        colony_name="Deepstone Fortress",
        storyteller_type=AIStorytellerPersonality.CASSANDRA
    )

    # Add 16 more dwarves
    for i in range(16):
        dwarf = Character(
            id=f"dwarf{i}",
            name=f"Dwarf{i}",
            age=random.randint(20, 60),
            role=random.choice(["Miner", "Brewer", "Mason", "Farmer"]),
            needs={"hunger": Need(), "rest": Need(), "happiness": Need()}
        )
        sim.characters.append(dwarf)

    # Run 5 years
    print("\nSimulating 5 years...")
    sim.run_simulation(days=1825, verbose=False)

    # Validate results
    stats = sim.chronicle.get_statistics()
    print(f"\n📊 Results:")
    print(f"   Total events: {stats['total_events']}")
    print(f"   Major events: {stats['major_events']}")
    print(f"   Deaths: {stats['deaths']}")

    # Export legend
    legend = sim.chronicle.generate_legend()
    print(f"\n📖 Legend generated: {len(legend)} characters")

    # Test criteria
    assert stats['major_events'] >= 10, "Need more major events over 5 years"
    assert stats['total_events'] >= 50, "Need more total events"
    print("\n✅ PASS: Generated rich multi-year chronicle")

# Note: Full tests would include all 6 pressure tests from requirements
# (Rimworld, EVE, Crusader Kings, Mount & Blade, The Sims)
# Truncated here for space - pattern is clear
```

### Validation: Did We Fix RED Failures?

Let's re-run the original failing scenario and measure improvement:

```python
def validate_improvements():
    """Compare RED baseline to GREEN implementation"""

    print("\n" + "=" * 70)
    print("VALIDATION: RED vs GREEN Comparison")
    print("=" * 70)

    print("\n[RED BASELINE - Original broken system]")
    print("  ❌ Bland simulation (numbers changing)")
    print("  ❌ No emotional variety")
    print("  ❌ Zero investment in characters")
    print("  ❌ No persistence")
    print("  ❌ Can't share stories")
    print("  ❌ Events have no weight")
    print("  ❌ No character development")
    print("  ❌ Isolated mechanics")
    print("  ❌ No narrative arc")
    print("  ❌ Nothing memorable")
    print("  Engagement Score: 0/10")

    print("\n[GREEN IMPLEMENTATION - Fixed system]")

    sim = NarrativeColonySimulator(
        colony_name="Test Colony",
        storyteller_type=AIStorytellerPersonality.CASSANDRA
    )

    sim.run_simulation(days=30, verbose=False)

    # Run quality tests
    tester = NarrativeQualityTest()
    results = tester.run_full_test_suite(sim)

    engagement_score = sum(results.values()) / len(results)

    print(f"\n✅ Dramatic events generated: {len(sim.chronicle.events)}")
    print(f"✅ Character arcs active: {len(sim.arc_manager.active_arcs)}")
    print(f"✅ Relationships formed: {len(sim.relationships.relationships)}")
    print(f"✅ Chronicle exportable: Yes")
    print(f"✅ Engagement Score: {engagement_score:.1f}/10")

    print(f"\n📈 IMPROVEMENT: {engagement_score:.1f}x better than baseline!")

    return engagement_score

if __name__ == "__main__":
    validate_improvements()
```

## Key Takeaways

### The Narrative Loop

```
State → Simulation → Event → Interpretation → Story → New State

The difference between boring and compelling:
BORING: State changes, player doesn't notice
COMPELLING: State changes, creates dramatic event, player FEELS it
```

### Four Layers of Narrative

1. **Simulation Layer**: What IS (health, hunger, position)
2. **Personality Layer**: Who they ARE (traits, values, growth)
3. **Relationship Layer**: How they CONNECT (love, hate, history)
4. **Narrative Layer**: What it MEANS (drama, emotion, memory)

### Core Principles

1. **Events need CONTEXT** - Not "health decreased" but "Marcus collapsed from exhaustion after working 3 days straight to save the colony"

2. **Relationships drive drama** - Love, hate, betrayal, loyalty create stories more than mechanics

3. **Characters must CHANGE** - Static personalities can't create arcs

4. **Pacing creates meaning** - Random events forever = noise. Structured rising action → climax → resolution = story

5. **Make it SHAREABLE** - If players can't retell your stories, they aren't good stories

### Implementation Priorities

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Character system with personality
- Relationship graph
- Event generation from world state

**Phase 2: Drama**
- AI storyteller for pacing
- Event chains (consequences)
- Character arcs

**Phase 3: Persistence**
- Chronicle system
- Biography tracking
- Exportable legends

**Phase 4: Polish**
- Social network analysis
- Cause/effect visualization
- Sharing tools

## Final Example: The Complete Picture

```python
# This is what we built:

# Before (RED):
while True:
    colonist.hunger += 10
    colonist.health -= 5
    # Boring numbers

# After (GREEN):
while True:
    # 1. Simulation
    colonist.needs['hunger'].current -= decay

    # 2. Generate dramatic event
    if colonist.needs['hunger'].is_critical():
        event = create_starvation_drama(colonist)

        # 3. Add emotional context
        event.emotional_tone = EmotionalTone.DESPAIRING
        event.magnitude = 6

        # 4. Affect relationships
        if colonist steals:
            victim.relationship -= 30
            event.consequences.append("Trust broken")

        # 5. Record in chronicle
        chronicle.record_event(event)

        # 6. Schedule future consequences
        schedule_revenge_event(+10 days)

        # 7. Check character arc progress
        if redemption_arc:
            arc.progress += 0.2

        # 8. Export for sharing
        chronicle.export_legend()

# Result: Compelling, memorable, shareable stories!
```

You've now learned how to build systems that generate stories, not just simulate worlds. Your players will create legends.
