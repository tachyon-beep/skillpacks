# Using Systems-as-Experience (Meta-Skill Router)

**Your entry point to the systems-as-experience skillpack.** This skill routes you to the right combination of specialized skills for your game design challenge.

## Purpose

This is a **meta-skill** that:
1. ✅ **Routes** you to the correct skills in this pack
2. ✅ **Combines** multiple skills for complex projects
3. ✅ **Provides** quick-start workflows for common game types
4. ✅ **Explains** the pack's philosophy and when to use it

**You should use this skill:** When starting any systems-driven game design project.

## Core Philosophy: Systems AS Experience

### The Central Idea

Traditional game design: **Systems support content**
- Design story → build mechanics to express it
- Design levels → build systems to populate them
- Content is king, systems are servants

Systems-as-experience: **Systems ARE the content**
- Design orthogonal mechanics → emergence creates "content"
- Design constraints → player creativity becomes gameplay
- Design for discovery → hidden depth rewards curiosity
- Systems are king, authored content is optional

### When This Philosophy Applies

**✅ Use systems-as-experience when:**
- Core loop is experimentation, creativity, or optimization
- Replayability through emergent outcomes is desired
- Player agency and expression are paramount
- Systems have inherent depth worth discovering
- Community-driven content extends game life

**❌ Don't use systems-as-experience when:**
- Authored narrative is primary experience
- Linear progression with fixed setpieces
- Cinematic, controlled emotional arcs
- Hand-crafted, bespoke content is the appeal

**Hybrid approach:** Most games blend both (BotW has authored Ganon encounter + emergent physics sandbox)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Starting with Wrong Skill
**Problem:** Jumping to optimization-as-play without emergent-gameplay-design foundation

**Symptom:** Optimization game with no depth (one optimal solution)

**Fix:** ALWAYS start with emergent-gameplay-design for orthogonal systems, THEN apply optimization

### Pitfall 2: Over-Applying All Skills
**Problem:** Trying to use all 8 skills on every project

**Symptom:** Scope creep, conflicting design goals, nothing gets finished

**Fix:** Use routing logic above. Most projects need 2-4 skills, not all 8.

### Pitfall 3: Skipping Foundation
**Problem:** Going straight to Wave 2/3 skills without Wave 1

**Symptom:** Surface-level implementation without systemic depth

**Fix:** emergent-gameplay-design is FOUNDATIONAL for most projects. Read it first.

### Pitfall 4: Not Recognizing Hybrid Design
**Problem:** Trying to make EVERYTHING systemic (including authored narrative)

**Symptom:** Losing authored emotional moments, pacing issues

**Fix:** Most games blend systems + authored content. BotW has both. Use routing logic for systems portion only.

### Pitfall 5: Underestimating Time
**Problem:** Thinking "I'll just add emergence" will take 30 minutes

**Symptom:** Rushed implementation, no playtesting, shallow system

**Fix:** Each skill requires 2-4 hours minimum. Budget 8-15 hours for multi-skill projects.

## Success Criteria

### Your project successfully uses systems-as-experience when:

**Emergence (Core):**
- [ ] Players discover solutions you didn't intend
- [ ] System interactions create "content"
- [ ] Replayability through emergent variety

**Depth:**
- [ ] Hidden depth rewards mastery
- [ ] Community discovers new strategies
- [ ] No single dominant strategy

**Discovery:**
- [ ] Curiosity is rewarded
- [ ] Secrets feel earned, not arbitrary
- [ ] "Aha moments" occur frequently

**Community:**
- [ ] Players create external tools (wikis, calculators)
- [ ] Meta-game emerges beyond playing
- [ ] Community extends game through mods/content

**Satisfaction:**
- [ ] Systems feel satisfying to master
- [ ] Optimization provides clear feedback
- [ ] Player expression is visible
