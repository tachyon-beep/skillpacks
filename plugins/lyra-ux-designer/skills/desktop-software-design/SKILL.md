# Desktop Software Design

## Overview

This skill provides **The Desktop Application Workflow Model**, a systematic 4-dimension methodology for designing native desktop applications that serve professional users and power workflows. Use this when designing productivity tools, creative software, development environments, or any application where users expect keyboard-driven efficiency, extensive customization, and multi-tasking capabilities.

**Core Principle**: Desktop applications serve power users who demand speed, precision, and control. Success means enabling keyboard-first workflows, supporting complex multi-window tasks, allowing deep workspace customization, and providing expert paths that accelerate professional workflows without overwhelming beginners.

**Focus**: Keyboard efficiency, multi-window organization, workspace persistence, and progressive disclosure of advanced features.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- Designing native desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Building Electron-based desktop apps
- Creating professional tools (IDEs, design software, DAWs, CAD)
- Implementing keyboard-driven interfaces for power users
- Designing multi-window or multi-document applications
- User mentions: "desktop app", "keyboard shortcuts", "menu bar", "workspace", "power user", "panels"

**Don't use this skill for:**
- Web applications (use `lyra/ux-designer/web-application-design`)
- Mobile apps (use `lyra/ux-designer/mobile-design-patterns`)
- Simple utility tools (may not need full desktop complexity)
- Kiosk or public terminal interfaces (different interaction model)

## The Desktop Application Workflow Model

A systematic 4-dimension evaluation model for desktop application design:

1. **WINDOW ORGANIZATION** - Multi-window, panels/palettes, tabbed interfaces, docking
2. **KEYBOARD EFFICIENCY** - Power user shortcuts, menu mnemonics, keyboard-first navigation
3. **WORKSPACE CUSTOMIZATION** - Toolbars, panels, themes, layouts, import/export settings
4. **EXPERT PATHS** - Advanced settings, scripting, batch operations, command palette, extensibility

Evaluate designs by examining each dimension systematically, ensuring window layouts support complex workflows, all actions are keyboard-accessible, users can adapt the interface to their needs, and advanced features are discoverable without overwhelming beginners.

- Hierarchical menus (submenu arrow: ▶)

### Context Menus (Right-Click)

**Purpose:** Quick access to contextual actions

**Trigger:**
- Right-click (mouse)
- Control+Click (macOS, one-button mouse)
- Shift+F10 or Menu key (keyboard)
- Long-press (touchscreen)

**Content:**
- Context-sensitive (different per item type)
- 5-10 items maximum
- Most common actions
- Dividers separate groups
- Dangerous actions at bottom (red text)

**Examples:**

**File Context Menu:**
```
Open
Open With              ▶
-----------------------
Get Info               Cmd+I
Rename                 F2

Copy                   Cmd+C
Paste                  Cmd+V
-----------------------
Look Up "[word]"
Search Google for "[selection]"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Top 5-7 actions (don't overwhelm)
- Match selected object (file, text, canvas object)
- Include keyboard shortcuts (discoverability)
- Close on click outside or ESC
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)

### Dialogs

**Purpose:** Modal and modeless windows for focused tasks

**Modal Dialogs:**

**Characteristics:**

- Must be dismissed before continuing
- Use for critical decisions (save before quit)
- Or complex forms (preferences)

**Examples:**
- Save confirmation: "Save changes before closing?"
- Preferences/Settings dialog
- Print dialog
- Error alerts

**Button Placement:**
- **macOS:** Right-aligned (Cancel left, OK/primary right)
- **Windows:** Right-aligned (OK left, Cancel right) — note: varies
- Primary action visually prominent (filled button)
- Cancel as secondary (outline button) or link

**Keyboard:**
- Enter: Primary action (OK, Save)
- ESC: Cancel or Close
- Tab: Navigate fields

**Modeless Dialogs:**

**Characteristics:**
- Float on top, don't block main window
- Can interact with main window while dialog open
- Use for reference or tools (Find & Replace, Color Picker)

**Examples:**
- Find & Replace (search while editing)
- Color picker (select colors while designing)
- Inspector panel (view properties)

**Best Practices:**
- Use modal for critical decisions only
- Modeless for tools and reference
- Clear primary action (visual weight)

- Last step: "Finish" or "Done"
- Progress indicator: "Step 2 of 4"
- Can skip optional steps

**Examples:**
- First-launch setup (choose preferences)
- Export wizard (format, quality, location)
- Import wizard (select source, map fields, import)
- Project setup (name, location, template)

**Best Practices:**
- Clear progress (step 2 of 4)
- Back button works (don't lose data)
- Skip optional steps (offer defaults)
- Review before final step (confirmation)
- Cancelable (ESC or Cancel button)

### File System Integration

**Purpose:** Native file operations and OS integration

**Open/Save Dialogs:**

**Native Dialogs:**
- Use OS-native file picker (NSOpenPanel on macOS, IFileOpenDialog on Windows)
- Users familiar with platform dialog
- Consistent with other apps
- Access to system features (favorites, recent, network)

**Open Dialog:**
- Choose file(s) to open
- File type filter (dropdown: "Images", "All Files")
- Multi-select (Cmd+Click / Ctrl+Click)
- Preview pane (if supported by OS)

**Save Dialog:**
- Choose location and filename
- File format dropdown (if multiple formats)
- Options expander (quality, settings)
- Overwrite confirmation (if file exists)

**Best Practices:**
- Remember last location (per dialog or global)
- Default filename (not "Untitled")
- Clear file format options
- Validate filename (illegal characters)

**Drag-and-Drop:**

**Accept Files:**
- Drag file from Finder/Explorer onto app window
- Visual feedback (border highlight, "Drop to open")
- Open file or import content

**Export via Drag:**
- Drag item from app to Finder/Explorer
- Creates file at drop location
- Or copy data to compatible app

**Best Practices:**

- Validate file types (reject incompatible)
- Handle errors gracefully (unsupported format)

**Quick Look / Preview (macOS):**
- Select file, press Space: Preview
- Support in your file format (implement Quick Look plugin)
- Thumbnail generation

**File Associations:**
- Register app as handler for file types (.psd, .sketch)
- Double-click file: Opens in your app
- Right-click file > Open With: Your app listed
- Set as default handler

**Best Practices:**
- Register relevant file extensions
- Provide app icon for file type
- Don't claim generic types (.txt) as default (without user choice)

### Status Bar

**Purpose:** Display status information and contextual hints

**Location:**
- Bottom of window (standard)
- Full-width bar

**Content:**

**Left Side:**
- Status text (e.g., "Ready", "Saving...", "23 items selected")
- Contextual hints ("Click to select")

**Right Side:**
- Indicators (e.g., "Ln 45, Col 12" in text editor)
- Progress bar (if operation in progress)
- Status icons (connection, sync, notifications)

**Examples:**
- **Text Editor:** Line/column number, character encoding, language mode
- **Web Browser:** URL on hover, page load progress
- **File Manager:** "12 items, 3 selected, 1.2 GB"

**Best Practices:**
- Always visible (not floating)
- Update in real-time (status changes)
- Clear, concise text
- Click to show details (e.g., click errors: show error list)

## Anti-Patterns

### Priority 0 (Critical - Never Do)

**1. No keyboard access to core features:**
- **Problem:** Mouse-only interface, excludes keyboard users
- **Impact:** Accessibility fail, WCAG violation, frustrates power users
- **Fix:** Tab navigation, keyboard shortcuts for all actions, focus indicators

**2. Non-standard shortcuts (Ctrl+S not saving):**
- **Problem:** Breaks user expectations, muscle memory fails
- **Impact:** Errors, frustration, slow workflow
- **Fix:** Use platform conventions (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S for save)

**3. Lost work (no autosave, no crash recovery):**
- **Problem:** Users lose hours of work on crash or accidental close
- **Impact:** Extreme frustration, negative reviews, lost trust
- **Fix:** Autosave drafts every 2-5 minutes, crash recovery, unsaved changes warning

**4. Unresponsive UI (blocking on long operations):**
- **Problem:** Entire app freezes during save, export, or processing
- **Impact:** Feels broken, users force-quit, lose work
- **Fix:** Background threads, progress indicator, cancelable operations

### Priority 1 (High - Avoid)

**5. Modal dialogs for every action:**
- **Problem:** Constant interruptions, slow workflow
- **Impact:** Annoying, inefficient, breaks concentration
- **Fix:** Inline editing, modeless panels, fewer confirmations

**6. No workspace persistence (lose layout on restart):**
- **Problem:** Users reconfigure panels and windows every session
- **Impact:** Time waste, frustration, inconsistent experience
- **Fix:** Save window positions, panel layout, open tabs between sessions

**7. Hidden essential features (no discoverability):**
- **Problem:** Power features exist but users never find them
- **Impact:** Underutilized features, users leave for competitors
- **Fix:** Command palette, tooltips, onboarding hints, help documentation

**8. Inconsistent UI (different patterns in different areas):**
- **Problem:** Save button top-right in one dialog, bottom-left in another
- **Impact:** Cognitive load, users must relearn each screen
- **Fix:** Design system, consistent button placement, standard patterns

### Priority 2 (Medium - Be Cautious)

**9. Too many customization options (overwhelming):**
- **Problem:** 500 settings in preferences, users lost
- **Impact:** Decision paralysis, never customize, confused
- **Fix:** Sensible defaults, progressive disclosure, basic vs advanced tabs

**10. Non-native file dialogs (platform inconsistency):**
- **Problem:** Custom file picker doesn't match OS
- **Impact:** Unfamiliar, lacks OS features (favorites, recent), confusing
- **Fix:** Use platform-native dialogs (NSOpenPanel, IFileOpenDialog)

**11. Reinventing standard controls:**
- **Problem:** Custom buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns that look/behave differently
- **Impact:** Users must learn new patterns, accessibility issues
- **Fix:** Use platform controls or follow established design systems

**12. Over-reliance on mouse (not keyboard-accessible):**
- **Problem:** Hover-only actions, drag-only reordering, no keyboard alternative
- **Impact:** Excludes keyboard users, slow for power users
- **Fix:** Keyboard shortcuts for all actions, Tab navigation, arrow keys
