# Using UX Designer

## Overview

This meta-skill routes you to the right UX design skills based on your situation. Load this skill when you need UX expertise but aren't sure which specific skill to use.

**Core Principle**: Different UX tasks require different skills. Match your situation to the appropriate skill, load only what you need.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Starting any UX/UI design task
- User mentions: "design", "UX", "UI", "interface", "user experience", "layout", "navigation"
- You need to critique or review a design
- You need to create a new interface or feature
- User asks about UX principles or concepts

**Don't use for**: Backend logic, database design, pure technical implementation without UX implications

## Routing by Situation

### Learning & Explanation

**Symptoms**: "What is...", "Explain...", "Teach me about...", "How does X work in UX?"

**Route to**: `lyra/ux-designer/ux-fundamentals`

**Examples**:
- "What is information architecture?" → ux-fundamentals
- "Explain visual hierarchy" → ux-fundamentals
- "How do I think about accessibility?" → ux-fundamentals

---

### Design Critique & Review

**Symptoms**: "Review this design", "Critique this interface", "Is this usable?", "Does this follow best practices?"

**Route to**: Relevant competency skills based on critique focus

**General Review** (no specific focus):
- `lyra/ux-designer/visual-design-foundations` (visual hierarchy, color, typography)
- `lyra/ux-designer/information-architecture` (content organization, navigation)
- `lyra/ux-designer/accessibility-and-inclusive-design` (WCAG, inclusive design)

**Specific Focus**:
- Visual issues (color, contrast, hierarchy) → `visual-design-foundations`
- Navigation/findability issues → `information-architecture`
- Interaction feedback, touch targets → `interaction-design-patterns`
- Accessibility concerns → `accessibility-and-inclusive-design`

**Add platform extension** if design is platform-specific:
- Mobile app → Add `mobile-design-patterns`
- Web dashboard → Add `web-application-design`
- Desktop software → Add `desktop-software-design`
- Game interface → Add `game-ui-design`

---

### New Interface Design

**Symptoms**: "Design a...", "Create interface for...", "Build a [feature] screen"

**Route to**: Competency skills + platform extension

**Standard Web/Mobile Feature**:
1. `lyra/ux-designer/visual-design-foundations` (layout, hierarchy, color)
2. `lyra/ux-designer/interaction-design-patterns` (buttons, feedback, states)
3. Platform-specific:
   - Mobile → `mobile-design-patterns`
   - Web app → `web-application-design`

**Complex Navigation/IA**:
1. `lyra/ux-designer/information-architecture` (content structure, nav systems)
2. `lyra/ux-designer/visual-design-foundations` (visual hierarchy)
3. Platform extension as needed

**Research Phase** (early discovery):
1. `lyra/ux-designer/user-research-and-validation` (understand users first)
2. Then return to design skills once research complete

---

### Specific UX Domains

#### Visual Design Issues

**Symptoms**: "Colors don't work", "Typography feels off", "Hierarchy unclear", "Layout cramped"

**Route to**: `lyra/ux-designer/visual-design-foundations`

**Load**: `ux-fundamentals` (teaches principles)

### Pattern 2: "Critique my [platform] design"
**Load**: visual-design + IA + accessibility + [platform-extension]

### Pattern 3: "Design [feature] for [platform]"
**Load**: Relevant competencies + [platform-extension]

### Pattern 4: "Is this accessible?"
**Load**: `accessibility-and-inclusive-design` (primary)
**Reference**: visual-design (contrast), interaction-design (keyboard nav)

### Pattern 5: "How do users navigate this?"
**Load**: `information-architecture` (primary)
**Add**: user-research-and-validation (if testing/validation needed)

## Benefits of Routing

**Focused expertise**: Load only what's needed for the task
**Clear boundaries**: Each skill has distinct responsibility
**Composable**: Combine skills for complex scenarios
**Efficient**: Avoid loading all 11 skills at once
**Explicit**: User sees which skills are active
