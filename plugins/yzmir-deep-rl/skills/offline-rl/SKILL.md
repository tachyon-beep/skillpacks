# Offline Reinforcement Learning

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you encounter:

- **Offline Dataset**: User has fixed dataset D, no environment access
- **Distribution Shift**: Policy improvements diverge from data collection distribution
- **Value Overestimation**: Learning from offline data causes Q-values to diverge
- **CQL/IQL Implementation**: Implementing conservative value estimation
- **Behavior Cloning Constraints**: How to keep policy close to data distribution
- **BCQ Algorithm**: Batch-Constrained Q-learning for offline control
- **Offline Evaluation**: Evaluating policy performance without environment interaction
- **When to Apply Offline RL**: Deciding if offline RL is needed vs online alternatives
- **Extrapolation Error**: Understanding why agents fail on OOD actions
- **Data Quality Impact**: How dataset composition affects algorithm choice

**This skill teaches learning from fixed datasets without environment interaction.**

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Online RL with environment interaction (use policy-gradient-methods, actor-critic-methods)
- Pure supervised learning on (s,a) pairs (that's behavior cloning, use supervised learning)
- Online model-free learning (use value-based-methods)
- Algorithm-agnostic debugging (use rl-debugging-methodology)

## Core Principle

**Offline RL learns from fixed datasets without environment interaction, solving the fundamental problem of value overestimation without online correction.**

The core insight: Standard RL algorithms (Q-learning, policy gradient) assume you can interact with environment to correct mistakes. Offline RL has no such luxury.

```
Online RL Problem:
  1. Agent explores environment
  2. Collects (s,a,r,s',d) transitions
  3. Updates value estimate: Q[s,a] ← r + γ max_a' Q[s',a']
  4. If Q overestimates, agent tries bad action
  5. Environment gives low reward
  6. Q-value corrects downward in next update

Offline RL Problem:
  1. Agent receives fixed dataset D
  2. Estimates Q from D only
  3. Updates value estimate: Q[s,a] ← r + γ max_a' Q[s',a']
  4. If Q overestimates (no data for some actions), agent tries bad action
  5. No feedback! Can't try action in environment
  6. Q-value never corrects. Error compounds.
  7. Policy diverges, performance collapses
```

**Without understanding extrapolation error and conservative value estimation, you'll implement algorithms that hallucinate value for unseen state-action pairs.**

---

## Part 1: The Offline RL Problem

### Offline RL Fundamentals

**Offline RL Setting**:
- You have fixed dataset D = {(s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i, d_i)} collected by unknown behavior policy
- No access to environment (can't interact)
- Goal: Learn policy π that maximizes expected return
- Constraint: Policy must work on real environment, not just in data

**Key Difference from Supervised Learning**:
```
Supervised Learning (behavior cloning):
  π = argmin_π E_{(s,a)~D}[||π(a|s) - β(a|s)||²]
  Problem: Learns data collection policy, can't improve

Offline RL:
  π = argmin_π E_{(s,a,r,s')~D}[Q(s,a) - μ(a|s)]
  Benefit: Uses reward signal to improve beyond data
  Challenge: Q-values unreliable outside data distribution
```

### Why Standard Q-Learning Fails on Offline Data

**The Extrapolation Problem**:

Imagine discrete MDP with 3 actions: left, right, wait.

```python
# Data collection: random policy samples uniformly
# States: {s1, s2}
# Dataset D:
# (s1, left, r=5, s1')
# (s1, left, r=4, s1')
# (s1, right, r=3, s1')
# (s2, wait, r=10, s2')
# (s2, wait, r=9, s2')
# (s1, right, r=2, s1')

# Training Q-Learning on D:
Q(s1, left) ≈ 4.5   # Average of data
Q(s1, right) ≈ 2.5  # Average of data
Q(s1, wait) ≈ ???   # No data! Network must extrapolate

# What does Q-network guess for Q(s1, wait)?
# Network sees:
#   - action=left → reward high
#   - action=right → reward low
#   - action=wait → no signal
# Worst case: network predicts Q(s1, wait) = 100 (hallucination!)

# Policy improvement:
π(a|s1) = argmax_a Q(s1, a)
         = argmax{4.5, 2.5, 100}
         = wait  # WRONG CHOICE!

# In real environment: s1 + wait = crash (reward = -100)
# Why? Network extrapolated wildly beyond training distribution.
```

**The Root Cause**:

1. Training signal only for actions in D
2. Network trained to minimize MSE on seen (s,a) pairs
3. For unseen (s,a), network interpolates/extrapolates
4. Extrapolation is unreliable in high dimensions
5. Policy picks extrapolated high values
6. In reality: catastrophic failure

### Distribution Shift and Policy Divergence

**The Core Challenge**:

```
Initial behavior policy β:
  Collects D by visiting state distribution d_β
  D covers: {actions β takes, rewards β gets}

Your learned policy π:
  Improves on β
  Visits different states: d_π
  Tries different actions: π(a|s)

Mismatch:
  - States in d_π but not d_β: Q has no data
  - Actions π takes but β doesn't: Q extrapolates
  - Q-estimates unreliable
  - Policy gets stuck in hallucinated high-value regions
```

**Example: Robot Manipulation**:

```
Data: Collected by [move_forward, move_left, grasp] policy
- Good at pushing objects forward
- Poor at pulling backward

Your offline-trained π:
- Learns forward motion works (in data)
- Learns backward motion has high Q (extrapolated!)
- Because backward unexplored, network guesses Q=50

Reality:
- Forward: actually good
- Backward: crashes into wall, r=-100
- Policy fails catastrophically

Why?
- Distribution shift: π tries backward, d_π ≠ d_β
- No data for backward actions
- Network extrapolates incorrectly
```

### Value Overestimation: The Central Problem

Standard Q-learning uses:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α(r + γ max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a))
                            └─ Greedy max
```

**The Problem with max_a'**:

```
With limited data:
- max_{a'} Q(s',a') picks highest Q-value
- But if Q overestimates for most actions
- max picks an overestimated value
- TD target is too high
- Q-values drift upward indefinitely
```

**Why Does This Happen Offline?**

Online RL:
```
Iteration 1:
  Q(s,a) = 10 (overestimate)
Iteration 2:
  Real transition: (s,a,r=-5,s')
  Q(s,a) ← -5 + γ max Q(s',a')
  If Q(s',a') corrected to 0, Q(s,a) ← -5
  Overestimation corrected!

Offline RL:
  Same transition in replay buffer D
  Q(s,a) ← -5 + γ max Q(s',a')
  But max Q(s',a') still overestimated (no correction)
  Q stays high, continues overestimating
  Error never corrects
```

---

## Part 2: Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)

### CQL: The Idea

**Conservative Q-Learning** directly addresses value overestimation by adding a **pessimistic lower bound**:

```
Standard Bellman (optimistic):
  Q(s,a) ← r + γ max_{a'} Q(s',a')

CQL (conservative):
  Q(s,a) ← r + γ max_{a'} (Q(s',a') - α * C(a'))

Where C(a') is a penalty for actions outside data distribution.
```

**Key Idea**: Penalize high Q-values for actions not well-represented in data.

**Key CQL Components**:

1. **CQL Penalty**: `logsumexp(Q_random) + logsumexp(Q_batch)`
   - Penalizes high Q-values for both random and batch actions
   - Forces Q-network to be pessimistic
   - Prevents extrapolation to unseen actions

2. **Conservative Target**: `r + γ(Q(s',a') - α*penalty)`
   - Lowers TD target by CQL penalty amount
   - Makes Q-estimates more conservative
   - Safer for policy improvement

3. **Behavior Cloning Network**: Estimates β(a|s)
   - Helps identify in-distribution actions
   - Can weight CQL penalty by action probability
   - Tighter constraint on constrained actions

### CQL Intuition

**What CQL Prevents**:

```
Without CQL:
Q(s1, wait) = 100  (hallucinated, no data)
π picks wait → disaster

With CQL:
Q_target for s1, wait includes penalty
Q_target = r + γ(Q(s',a') - α * log(sum exp(Q)))
         = r + γ(50 - 100)
         = r - 50 * γ
CQL pessimism forces Q(s1, wait) low
π picks safer action

Result: Policy stays in data distribution, avoids hallucinated values
```

### When CQL Works Well

- **Short horizons**: Errors don't compound as much
- **Diverse data**: Multiple actions represented
- **Known behavior policy**: Can weight penalty appropriately
- **Discrete actions**: Easier to evaluate all actions

### CQL Failure Modes

- **Too conservative on good data**: May not improve over β
- **High variance penalties**: log-sum-exp can be unstable
- **Computational cost**: Requires sampling many actions

---

## Part 3: Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)

### IQL: A Different Approach to Pessimism

While CQL explicitly penalizes OOD actions, **IQL** achieves pessimism through a different mechanism: **expectile regression**.

```
Standard L2 Regression (mean):
  Expected value minimizes E[(y - ŷ)²]

Expectile Regression (quantile-like):
  Expects value minimizes E[|2τ - 1| * |y - ŷ|] for τ in (0,1)
  - τ < 0.5: underestimates (pessimistic)
  - τ = 0.5: median (neutral)
  - τ > 0.5: overestimates (optimistic)
```

### IQL Implementation

**Key Insight**: Use expectile loss to make Q-estimates naturally pessimistic without explicit penalties.

```python
class IQLAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim=256, expectile=0.7):
        self.Q = self._build_q_network(state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.V = self._build_v_network(state_dim, hidden_dim)  # Value function

        self.Q_optimizer = Adam(self.Q.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
        self.V_optimizer = Adam(self.V.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

        self.expectile = expectile  # τ = 0.7 for slight pessimism
        self.discount = 0.99
        self.temperature = 1.0  # For policy softness

    def expectile_loss(self, diff, expectile):
        """

```

### IQL Key Insight

**Why V-function Makes Q Pessimistic**:

```
Standard Q-Learning:
  Q(s,a) = r + γ max_a' Q(s',a')  ← Optimistic!

IQL:
  1. Train V(s) to estimate Q under behavior policy
     V(s) ≈ E_a~β[Q(s,a)]
  2. Use V as target: Q(s,a) = r + γ V(s')
     Why pessimistic?

     If policy is suboptimal:
       - Good actions: Q > V(s) (above average)
       - Bad actions: Q < V(s) (below average)
       - max_a Q(s',a') picks good action (might extrapolate)
       - V(s') is average (conservative)

    Result: Using V instead of max prevents picking overestimated actions!
```

### Expectile Loss Intuition

```
Standard MSE: E[(Q - V)²]
  - Symmetric penalty: overestimation = underestimation

Expectile Loss (τ=0.7): E[|2*0.7 - 1| * |Q - V|²]
  - When Q > V: weight = 0.7 (moderate penalty)
  - When Q < V: weight = 0.3 (light penalty)
  - Result: V underestimates Q slightly

Effect: Q values are naturally pessimistic without explicit penalties!
```

### When IQL Excels

- **High-dimensional observations**: V-function is simpler than Q
- **Continuous actions**: No need to discretize
- **Mixed quality data**: Expectile naturally handles varying data quality
- **Implicit distribution shift handling**: V-function implicitly constrains to data distribution

---

## Part 4: Batch-Constrained Q-Learning (BCQ)

### BCQ: Constraining Policy to Behavior Support

**Core Idea**: Only improve actions that have **high probability under behavior policy β**.

```
Standard offline improvement:
  π(a|s) ← exp(Q(s,a) / τ)  ← Can pick any action!

BCQ improvement:
  π(a|s) ← exp(Q(s,a) / τ) * I(β(a|s) > threshold)
           └─ Only if action has nonzero β probability
```

### BCQ Core Mechanism

```
Batch Constraint Principle:

Without BCQ:
  Policy π can pick ANY action
  Problem: Picks actions not in dataset
  Result: Q overestimates for unseen actions

With BCQ:
  Policy π = β(s) + small_perturbation(s)
  Constraint: π must stay close to β
  Result: Only slightly improves on data actions

Why it works:
  - Q is accurate for β-like actions (in data)
  - Perturbations are small (confidence is high)
  - Policy can't escape to hallucinated region
  - Safe policy improvement
```

### When BCQ is Appropriate

- **Very limited data**: Strict constraint needed
- **Expert data with mistakes**: Learn expert actions ± small perturbations
- **Safety-critical**: Can't risk exploring OOD actions
- **Discrete action space**: Easier to enumerate nearby actions

### BCQ Pitfalls

- **Too restrictive**: Can't leverage good data effectively
- **Assumes β is reasonable**: If β is terrible, BCQ learns terrible policy
- **Perturbation network complexity**: Another network to train

## Part 5: Distribution Shift and Offline Evaluation

### Understanding Distribution Shift in Offline RL

**The Core Challenge**:

```
Training distribution:
  States visited by β (behavior policy)
  Actions β typically takes
  Transitions β experiences

Evaluation distribution:
  States visited by π (learned policy)
  Actions π learns to take
  Transitions π will experience

Problem:
  Training and evaluation distributions diverge
  π will visit states not in training data
  Q-estimates unreliable for those states
```

### Offline Evaluation Without Environment Interaction

**The Problem**:

```
Online RL:
  π ← train(D)
  eval_return = run_policy(π, env, episodes=100)
  Simple and accurate

Offline RL:
  π ← train(D)
  Can't run in environment (offline constraint!)
  Must estimate return without interaction
  How to evaluate without cheating?
```

### Offline Evaluation Methods

**Method 1: Importance Sampling**

```python
def importance_sampling_eval(policy_pi, dataset_D):
    """
    Estimate E[G_π] using importance sampling.

    Key idea:
    E[G_π] = E_{(s,a,...)~π}[G]
           = E_{(s,a,...)~β}[G * (π(a|s)/β(a|s))]

    Use dataset transitions weighted by policy ratio.
    """
    total_return = 0
    total_weight = 0

    for trajectory in dataset_D:
        # Trajectory importance ratio
        traj_ratio = 1.0
        traj_return = 0

        for t, (s, a, r) in enumerate(trajectory):
            # Importance weight for this action
            pi_prob = policy_pi.log_prob(a, s).exp()
            beta_prob = behavior_policy.log_prob(a, s).exp()

            weight = pi_prob / (beta_prob + 1e-8)

            # Importance ratio for trajectory
            traj_ratio *= weight

            # Accumulate return
            traj_return += (0.99 ** t) * r

        # Weight trajectory by importance ratio
        total_return += traj_ratio * traj_return
        total_weight += traj_ratio

    # Average weighted return
    estimated_return = total_return / total_weight
    return estimated_return
```

**Problem**: High variance with small β probability. Weight explodes.

**Method 2: Regression Importance Sampling (RIS)**

```python
def ris_eval(policy_pi, dataset_D, value_fn):
    """
    Regression Importance Sampling: combines IS with value function
    to reduce variance.

    Idea: Use learned V-function for long horizons, IS for short.
    """
    total_return = 0
    total_weight = 0

    for trajectory in dataset_D:
        for t, (s, a, r, s_next) in enumerate(trajectory):
            # Importance weight for this step
            pi_prob = policy_pi.log_prob(a, s).exp()
            beta_prob = behavior_policy.log_prob(a, s).exp()

            is_weight = pi_prob / (beta_prob + 1e-8)

            # Value of next state
            v_next = value_fn(s_next)

            # Hybrid estimate: IS-weighted reward + V-estimate of rest
            return_est = r + 0.99 * v_next
            weighted_return = is_weight * return_est

            total_return += weighted_return
            total_weight += is_weight

    return total_return / total_weight
```

**Method 3: Model-based Estimation**

```python
def model_based_eval(policy_pi, dataset_D, dynamics_model):
    """
    Use learned dynamics model to estimate policy performance.

    Idea: π(s) → a, dynamics_model(s,a) → s', Q(s,a) → r
    """
    initial_states = dataset_D.sample_initial_states(batch_size=100)

    total_return = 0

    for s in initial_states:
        traj_return = 0
        done = False

        for t in range(horizon):
            # Policy action
            a = policy_pi.select_action(s)

            # Model prediction
            s_next = dynamics_model(s, a)
            r = reward_fn(s, a)  # or Q(s,a)

            # Accumulate return
            traj_return += (0.99 ** t) * r

            s = s_next
            if done:
                break

        total_return += traj_return

    estimated_return = total_return / len(initial_states)
    return estimated_return
```

### Offline Evaluation Challenges

```
Challenge 1: Importance Weight Explosion
  - If β rarely takes action π prefers
  - IS weight = π(a|s)/β(a|s) becomes huge
  - Estimate has infinite variance

Challenge 2: V-Function Errors
  - If V-function incorrect
  - RIS estimates still wrong
  - Can't correct without environment feedback

Challenge 3: Model Errors
  - If dynamics model wrong
  - Model-based estimates diverge from reality
  - Especially bad for long horizons

Solution: Use multiple methods, cross-validate
  - If all methods agree: estimate is reliable
  - If methods disagree: be suspicious, try online validation
```

## Part 6: When Offline RL is Needed

### Decision Framework: Offline vs Online RL

**Question 1: Can you collect more data?**

```
YES → Consider online RL
  - Use environment interaction
  - Standard algorithms work well
  - Lower algorithmic complexity

NO → Offline RL necessary
  - Fixed dataset only
  - Learn without interaction
  - Handle overestimation explicitly
```

**Question 2: Is data collection expensive?**

```
YES (expensive) → Offline RL pays off
  - Robot experiments: $1000+ per hour
  - Medical trials: ethical constraints
  - Real-world deployment: safety concerns

NO (cheap) → Online RL usually better
  - Simulation available
  - Data generation easy
  - Self-play systems
```

**Question 3: Is data collection dangerous?**

```
YES → Offline RL + careful validation
  - Autonomous driving
  - Nuclear plants
  - Medical systems
  - Learn conservatively from past experience

NO → Online RL fine
  - Game environments
  - Safe simulators
  - Can afford exploration failures
```

### When Offline RL is Essential

**1. Real-World Robotics**
```
Problem: Collect trajectory = robot experiment
Cost: $$$, time, expertise
Solution: Offline RL from logged demonstrations

Example: Learning from human tele-operation logs
- Data collection: humans control robot
- Training: offline RL from logs
- Deployment: robot improves on human behavior

Why offline RL helps:
- Can't try random actions (breaks hardware)
- Can't explore unsafely (danger)
- Limited budget for experiments
```

**2. Medical Treatment Policies**
```
Problem: Can't experiment on patients
Data: Historical patient records
Solution: Offline RL to find better treatments

Example: Learning antibiotic treatment policies
- Data: patient → treatment → outcome logs
- Training: offline RL from historical data
- Deployment: recommend treatments

Why offline RL helps:
- Can't do random exploration (unethical)
- Patient outcomes matter immediately
- Limited patient population
```

**3. Recommendation Systems**
```
Problem: Users leave if recommendations bad
Data: Historical user interactions
Solution: Offline RL to improve recommendations

Example: Movie recommendations
- Data: user watches movie → rates it
- Training: offline RL from interaction logs
- Deployment: recommend movies offline users will like

Why offline RL helps:
- Online experiment = worse user experience
- Can't A/B test extensively (business impact)
- Massive data available (can be offline)
```

### When Online RL is Better

**1. Simulation Available**
```
Example: Atari games
- Infinite free samples
- Can explore safely
- Rewards deterministic
- Online RL solves it easily

Why offline RL unnecessary:
- Data collection cost ≈ 0
- Exploration safe (it's a game)
- Online algorithms highly optimized
```

**2. Self-Play Systems**
```
Example: Chess, Go
- Generate own data
- Unlimited exploration budget
- Learn strong policies easily
- Online RL natural

Why offline RL adds complexity:
- Data generation is free (self-play)
- Can afford to explore
- Online algorithms work better
```

**3. Simulator Fidelity is High**
```
Example: Training in simulation, deploy in reality
- Simulator accurate enough
- Can collect unlimited data
- Distribution shift minimal (sim matches reality)
- Online RL sufficient

Why offline RL unnecessary:
- Can collect all needed data in simulation
- Don't have distribution shift problem
```

## Part 7: Common Pitfalls and Red Flags

### Pitfall 1: Assuming Online Algorithm Will Work

**Red Flag**: "I'll just use DQN/PPO on my offline data."

**Reality**: Will overestimate values, learn poor policy.

**Example**:
```
Dataset: suboptimal human demonstrations
DQN trained on D: max Q estimated for unseen actions
Result: Policy picks actions never in dataset
Reality: actions fail in deployment

Correct approach:
- Use CQL/IQL to address overestimation
- Constrain policy to behavior support (BCQ)
- Evaluate carefully offline before deployment
```

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Distribution Shift

**Red Flag**: "Policy divergence shouldn't be a problem if data is diverse."

**Reality**: Even diverse data has gaps. Policy will find them.

**Example**:
```
Dataset: collected over 6 months, diverse actions
Your policy: learns to combine actions in novel ways
Result: visits unseen state combinations
Q-estimates fail for combinations not in data

Correct approach:
- Monitor policy divergence from data
- Use uncertainty estimates (ensemble Q-networks)
- Gradually deploy, validate offline metrics
```

### Pitfall 3: Evaluating Offline with Online Metrics

**Red Flag**: "I trained the policy, let me just run it in the environment to evaluate."

**Reality**: That's not offline RL anymore! Defeats the purpose.

**Example**:
```
Offline RL goal: learn without environment interaction
Wrong evaluation: run π in environment 1000 times
Result: uses 1000s of samples for evaluation

Correct approach:
- Use offline evaluation methods (IS, RIS, model-based)
- Validate offline estimates before deployment
- Use conservative estimates (pessimistic evaluation)
```

### Pitfall 4: Not Considering Data Quality

**Red Flag**: "My algorithm is robust, it handles any data."

**Reality**: Offline RL performance depends critically on data quality.

**Example**:
```
Good data: expert demonstrations, well-explored actions
CQL: performs well, conservative works fine

Bad data: random exploration, sparse rewards
CQL: learns very slowly (too pessimistic)
BCQ: learns random behavior (constrained to β)

Solution: Analyze data quality first
- Percent expert vs random actions
- Return distribution
- Action coverage
- Choose algorithm for data type
```

### Pitfall 5: Overestimating Conservatism

**Red Flag**: "I'll use maximum pessimism to be safe."

**Reality**: Too much pessimism prevents learning anything.

**Example**:
```
Hyperparameter: CQL weight α = 1000 (extreme)
Result: Q(s,a) always negative (super pessimistic)
Policy: learns random actions (all have low Q)
Performance: no improvement over random

Correct approach:
- Tune conservatism to data quality
- Diverse data: less pessimism (CQL weight = 0.1)
- Limited data: more pessimism (CQL weight = 1.0)
- Validate offline evaluation metrics
```

### Pitfall 6: Forgetting Batch Constraints

**Red Flag**: "CQL handles distribution shift, I don't need behavior cloning."

**Reality**: CQL addresses overestimation, not policy divergence.

**Example**:
```
CQL alone:
Q-values conservative (good)
Policy gradient: π(a|s) = exp(Q(s,a) / τ)
Policy can still diverge far from β (bad)
New states visited, Q unreliable

CQL + behavior cloning:
Q-values conservative
Policy constrained: π ≈ β + improvement
Policy stays near data
Safe exploration

Solution: Combine approaches
- CQL for value estimation
- KL constraint for policy divergence
- Behavior cloning for explicit constraint
```

### Pitfall 7: Using Wrong Evaluation Metric

**Red Flag**: "I'll just report average Q-value as evaluation metric."

**Reality**: Q-values can be hallucinated!

**Example**:
```
High Q-values don't mean high returns
- If Q overestimates: high Q, low actual return
- If data is poor: high Q, bad actions

Correct metrics:
- Importance sampling estimate (IS)
- Regression IS estimate (RIS, lower variance)
- Model-based estimate (if model good)
- Conservative: min of multiple estimates
```

### Pitfall 8: Not Handling Batch Imbalance

**Red Flag**: "I have 1M samples, that's enough data."

**Reality**: Sample diversity matters more than quantity.

**Example**:
```
Dataset composition:
- 900K samples: random actions
- 100K samples: expert demonstrations

Training:
- Q-network sees mostly random behavior
- Expert actions are rare
- Q overestimates expert actions (underfitting them)

Solution:
- Stratified sampling (balance expert/random)
- Importance weighting (weight rare samples higher)
- Separate Q-networks for different behavior types
```

### Pitfall 9: Assuming Stationary Environment

**Red Flag**: "Environment hasn't changed, my offline policy should work."

**Reality**: Without online validation, you can't detect environment shifts.

**Example**:
```
Training period: robot arm dynamics stable
Deployment period: arm friction increased
Offline estimate: predicted 50 reward
Actual return: 20 reward

Why? Q-function trained on different dynamics.

Solution:
- Monitor deployment performance vs offline estimate
- If large gap: retrain on new data
- Use online validation after deployment
```

### Pitfall 10: Not Accounting for Reward Uncertainty

**Red Flag**: "Rewards are fixed, no uncertainty."

**Reality**: Sparse/noisy rewards create uncertainty in Q-estimates.

**Example**:
```
Sparse reward environment:
- Most transitions have r = 0
- Few transitions have r = 1 (sparse signal)
- Q-function must extrapolate from few examples

CQL without reward uncertainty:
- Pessimistic on actions, not rewards
- Misses that some Q-high states might have low actual reward

Solution:
- Ensemble Q-networks (estimate uncertainty)
- Use epistemic uncertainty in policy improvement
- Conservative value averaging (use min over ensemble)
```

---

## Part 8: Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Robot Manipulation

**Problem**: Train robot to pick and place objects from demonstrations.

```
Data:
- 50 human teleoperation episodes (~500 transitions each)
- Expert actions: picking, placing, moving
- Cost: each episode = 1 hour robot time

Why offline RL:
- Data collection expensive (human time)
- Can't explore randomly (break hardware)
- Want to improve on expert (BC alone isn't enough)

Solution: IQL
- Learns from expert demonstrations
- V-function constraints policy to expert-like state distribution
- Iteratively improves on expert with confidence

Results:
- Offline training: 2 hours GPU
- Online validation: 1 hour robot time
- Policy: 50% success rate improvement over expert
```

### Case Study 2: Recommendation Systems

**Problem**: Improve movie recommendations from historical user interactions.

```
Data:
- 100M user-movie interactions (1 year history)
- Reward: user watches movie (r=1) or skips (r=0)
- Distribution: mix of random recommendations and human editorial

Why offline RL:
- Online A/B test = worse user experience
- Can't explore randomly (hurts engagement metrics)
- But can learn better recommendations from behavior

Solution: CQL
- Conservatively estimates Q(user, movie)
- Avoids recommending movies only hypothetically good
- Safely recommends movies similar to successful past

Results:
- Offline metrics: 20% improvement over heuristics
- A/B test: 8% improvement (offline was too conservative)
- Trade-off: offline pessimism vs online optimality
```

### Case Study 3: Medical Treatment Policy

**Problem**: Learn treatment policy from patient records to minimize mortality.

```
Data:
- 50K patient records (diverse treatments, outcomes)
- Actions: drug choices, dosages, procedures
- Reward: patient survives (r=1) or dies (r=-100)

Why offline RL:
- Can't experiment on patients (unethical)
- Sparse reward (most patients live)
- Distribution shift (changing patient population)

Solution: BCQ + IQL hybrid
- BCQ: only improve on treatments in data (avoid new untested drugs)
- IQL: expectile regression handles sparse rewards naturally
- Conservative deployment: start with small population, validate

Challenges:
- Data collection bias (sicker patients get more aggressive treatment)
- Measurement error (outcomes uncertain)
- Non-stationarity (medical practices evolve)

Results:
- Offline validation: policy seems better
- Pilot deployment: 2% improvement
- Requires continuous retraining as new data arrives
```

---

## Part 9: Advanced Topics

### Topic 1: Conservative Q-Learning Variants

**CQL with Importance Weighting**:
```
Instead of treating all actions equally in CQL penalty,
weight by behavioral policy probability:

CQL loss = -α * E[(1-β(a|s))/(1+β(a|s)) * Q(s,a)]
           + E[Q(s,a) - target]

Intuition: Heavy penalty on unlikely actions, light penalty on likely ones
Result: More efficient use of data, can improve more than standard CQL
```

**Weighted CQL for Reward Maximization**:
```
Modify target to emphasize high-reward trajectories:

CQL loss = -α * E[weight(r) * Q(s,a)] + E[(Q - target)²]

where weight(r) = high if r is high, low if r is low

Result: Faster learning from expert demonstrations
Trade-off: Less conservative, more risk of overestimation
```

### Topic 2: Offline RL with Function Approximation Errors

When using neural networks, approximation errors can compound:

```
Error compound formula:
  Total error ≈ sum of:
  1. Bellman error: |r + γ V(s') - Q(s,a)|
  2. Approximation error: |Q_approx(s,a) - Q_true(s,a)|
  3. Extrapolation error: error magnitude grows with |s - data_states|

Solutions:
- Use ensemble networks (estimate uncertainty)
- Conservative value updates (take min over ensemble)
- Explicit uncertainty penalties
```

### Topic 3: Offline-to-Online Fine-Tuning

```
Real-world often requires offline pre-training + online fine-tuning:

Phase 1: Offline training
  - Learn from fixed dataset
  - Use CQL/IQL for value stability

Phase 2: Online fine-tuning
  - Collect new data with learned policy
  - Fine-tune with reduced exploration (avoid undoing offline learning)
  - Use importance weighting to not forget offline data

Example: Robotics
  - Offline: learn from 1 month of demonstrations
  - Online: 1 week fine-tuning with real environment
  - Combined: policy leverages both demonstrations and interaction
```

## Part 10: Debugging and Diagnosis

### Diagnostic Question 1: Are Q-Values Reasonable?

**How to Check**:
```python
# Sample random trajectory from dataset
state = dataset.sample_state()
for action in range(num_actions):
    q_val = Q(state, action)
    print(f"Q({state}, {action}) = {q_val}")

# Reasonable bounds:
# - Q-values should match observed returns (~10-100 for most tasks)
# - Not astronomical (1000+) without justification
# - Negative only if task is hard
```

**Red Flags**:
- Q-values > 1000: overestimation (increase CQL weight)
- Q-values all negative: pessimism too high (decrease CQL weight)
- Q-values constant: network not learning (check training loss)

### Diagnostic Question 2: Is Policy Diverging from Behavior?

**How to Check**:
```python
# Compute KL divergence between learned π and behavior β
kl_div = 0
for state in test_states:
    pi_logprobs = π.log_prob(state)
    beta_logprobs = β.log_prob(state)
    kl_div += (pi_logprobs.exp() * (pi_logprobs - beta_logprobs)).mean()

# Reasonable KL divergence:
# - < 1.0 bit: small divergence (safe)
# - 1.0-5.0 bits: moderate divergence (watch for OOD)
# - > 5.0 bits: severe divergence (use more regularization)
```

**Fixes**:
- Too much divergence: increase KL constraint weight
- Too little divergence: decrease constraint (not learning)

### Diagnostic Question 3: Offline vs Online Performance Gap

```python
# Estimate offline performance (no environment interaction)
offline_return_estimate = importance_sampling_eval(policy_π, dataset)

# Estimate online performance (if possible to test)
online_return_actual = run_policy(policy_π, environment, episodes=10)

# Gap analysis:
gap = online_return_actual - offline_return_estimate

# Interpretation:
# gap ≈ 0: offline estimates reliable
# gap > 10%: offline estimate optimistic (increase pessimism)
# gap < -10%: offline estimate too pessimistic (decrease pessimism)
```
