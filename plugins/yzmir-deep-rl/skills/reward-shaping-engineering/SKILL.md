# Reward-Shaping Engineering

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you encounter:

- **Reward Design**: "How do I design the reward function for my task?"
- **Slow Learning**: "Training is extremely slow with sparse rewards" or "Dense rewards cause weird behavior"
- **Reward Hacking**: "My agent learned a trick that works in training but fails on test", "Agent oscillating instead of balancing"
- **Potential-Based Shaping**: "How to add shaping without breaking the optimal policy?"
- **Distance-Based Rewards**: "How to reward progress toward goal without hacking?"
- **Inverse RL**: "I have expert demonstrations, can I learn reward from them?"
- **Auxiliary Rewards**: "Should I add helper rewards like action smoothness?"
- **Reward Scale Issues**: "Training feels different when rewards change magnitude"
- **Sparse vs Dense**: "When should I use sparse vs dense rewards?"
- **Reward Validation**: "How do I verify my reward function is correct?"
- **Credit Assignment**: "How to help agent understand which actions led to success?"
- **Normalization**: "Should I clip or normalize rewards?"

**This skill provides systematic frameworks and concrete patterns for reward engineering.**

Do NOT use for:
- Algorithm selection (route to rl-foundations or specific algorithm skill)
- General RL debugging (route to rl-debugging-methodology)
- Exploration strategies (route to exploration-strategies)
- Environment design (route to environment-design-patterns)

## Core Principle

**Reward design is often the hardest part of RL.** The reward function defines the entire objective the agent optimizes. A poorly designed reward either:
1. Learns something unintended (reward hacking)
2. Learns slowly due to sparse/noisy signal (credit assignment crisis)
3. Learns correctly but unstably due to scale/normalization issues

The key insight: **You're solving an inverse problem.** You want an agent that achieves behavior X. You need to specify function R(s,a,s') such that optimal policy under R produces behavior X. This is much harder than it sounds because:

- Agents optimize expected return, not intentions (find loopholes)
- Credit assignment requires clear reward signal (sparse rewards fail)
- Scale/normalization matters (reward magnitude affects gradients)
- Shaping can help or hurt (need to preserve optimal policy)

---

## Part 1: Reward Design Principles

### Principle 1: Reward Must Align With Task

**The Problem**: You want agent to do X, but reward incentivizes Y.

**Example (CartPole)**:
- Task: Balance pole in center for as long as possible
- Bad reward: +1 per step (true) → Agent learns to oscillate side-to-side (unintended but gets +1 every step)
- Better reward: +1 per step centered + penalty for deviation

**Example (Robotics)**:
- Task: Grasp object efficiently
- Bad reward: Just +1 when grasped → Agent grasps sloppily, jerky movements
- Better reward: +1 for grasp + small penalty per action (reward efficiency)

**Pattern**: Specify WHAT success looks like, not HOW to achieve it. Let agent find the HOW.

```python
# Anti-pattern: Specify HOW
bad_reward = -0.1 * np.sum(np.abs(action))  # Penalize movement

# Pattern: Specify WHAT
good_reward = (1.0 if grasp_success else 0.0) + (-0.01 * np.sum(action**2))
# Says: Success is good, movements have small cost
# Agent figures out efficient movements to minimize action cost
```

### Principle 2: Reward Should Enable Credit Assignment

**The Problem**: Sparse rewards mean agent can't learn which actions led to success.

**Example (Goal Navigation)**:
- Sparse: Only +1 when reaching goal (1 in 1000 episodes maybe)
- Agent can't tell: Did action 10 steps ago help or action 5 steps ago?
- Solution: Add shaping reward based on progress

**Credit Assignment Window**:
```
Short window (< 10 steps):    Need dense rewards every 1-2 steps
Medium window (10-100 steps): Reward every 5-10 steps OK
Long window (> 100 steps):    Sparse rewards very hard, need shaping
```

**When to Add Shaping**:
- Episode length > 50 steps AND sparse rewards
- Agent can't achieve >10% success after exploring


### Principle 3: Reward Should Prevent Hacking

**The Problem**: Agent finds unintended loopholes.

**Classic Hacking Patterns**:

1. **Shortcut Exploitation**: Taking unintended path to goal
   - Example: Quadruped learns to flip instead of walk
   - Solution: Specify movement requirements in reward

2. **Side-Effect Exploitation**: Achieving side-effect that gives reward
   - Example: Robotic arm oscillating (gets +1 per step for oscillation)
   - Solution: Add penalty for suspicious behavior

3. **Scale Exploitation**: Abusing unbounded reward dimension
   - Example: Agent learns to get reward signal to spike → oscillates
   - Solution: Use clipped/normalized rewards

**Prevention Framework**:
```python
def design_robust_reward(s, a, s_next):
    # Core task reward
    task_reward = compute_task_reward(s_next)

    # Anti-hacking penalties
    action_penalty = -0.01 * np.sum(a**2)  # Penalize unnecessary action
    suspension_penalty = check_suspension(s_next)  # Penalize weird postures

    return task_reward + action_penalty + suspension_penalty
```

### Principle 4: Reward Scale and Normalization Matter

**The Problem**: Reward magnitude affects gradient flow.

**Example**:
```
Task A rewards:  0 to 1000
Task B rewards:  0 to 1
Same optimizer with fixed learning rate:
  Task A: Step sizes huge, diverges
  Task B: Step sizes tiny, barely learns

Solution: Normalize both to [-1, 1]
```

**Standard Normalization Pipeline**:
```python
def normalize_reward(r):
    # 1. Clip to reasonable range (prevents scale explosions)
    r_clipped = np.clip(r, -1000, 1000)

    # 2. Normalize using running statistics
    reward_mean = running_mean(r_clipped)
    reward_std = running_std(r_clipped)
    r_normalized = (r_clipped - reward_mean) / (reward_std + 1e-8)

    # 3. Clip again to [-1, 1] for stability
    return np.clip(r_normalized, -1.0, 1.0)
```

---

## Part 2: Potential-Based Shaping (The Theorem)

### The Fundamental Problem

You want to:
- Help agent learn faster (add shaping rewards)
- Preserve the optimal policy (so shaping doesn't change what's best)

**The Solution: Potential-Based Shaping**

The theorem states: If you add shaping reward of form
```
F(s, a, s') = γ * Φ(s') - Φ(s)
```
where Φ(s) is ANY function of state, then:
1. Optimal policy remains unchanged
2. Optimal value function shifts by Φ
3. Learning accelerates due to better signal

**Why This Matters**: You can safely add rewards like distance-to-goal without worrying you're changing what the agent should do.

### Mathematical Foundation

Original MDP has Q-function: `Q^π(s,a) = E[R(s,a,s') + γV^π(s')]`

With potential-based shaping:
```
Q'^π(s,a) = Q^π(s,a) + [γΦ(s') - Φ(s)]
          = E[R(s,a,s') + γΦ(s') - Φ(s) + γV^π(s')]
          = E[R(s,a,s') + γ(Φ(s') + V^π(s')) - Φ(s)]
```

The key insight: When computing optimal policy, Φ(s) acts like state-value function offset. Different actions get different Φ values, but relative ordering (which action is best) unchanged.

**Proof Sketch**:
- Policy compares Q(s,a₁) vs Q(s,a₂) to pick action
- Both differ by same [γΦ(s') - Φ(s)] at state s
- Relative ordering preserved → same optimal action

### Practical Implementation

```python
def potential_based_shaping(s, a, s_next, gamma=0.99):
    """
    Compute shaping reward that preserves optimal policy.

    Args:
        s: current state
        a: action taken
        s_next: next state (result of action)
        gamma: discount factor

    Returns:
        Shaping reward to ADD to environment reward
    """
    # Define potential function (e.g., negative distance to goal)
    phi = compute_potential(s)
    phi_next = compute_potential(s_next)

    # Potential-based shaping formula
    shaping_reward = gamma * phi_next - phi

    return shaping_reward

def compute_potential(s):
    """
    Potential function: Usually distance to goal.

    Negative of distance works well:
    - States farther from goal have lower potential
    - Moving closer increases potential (positive shaping reward)
    - Reaching goal gives highest potential
    """
    if goal_reached(s):
        return 0.0  # Peak potential
    else:
        distance = euclidean_distance(s['position'], s['goal'])
        return -distance  # Negative distance
```

### Critical Error: NOT Using Potential-Based Shaping

**Common Mistake**:
```python
# WRONG: This changes the optimal policy!
shaping_reward = -0.1 * distance_to_goal

# WHY WRONG: This isn't potential-based. Moving from d=1 to d=0.5 gives:
#   Reward = -0.1 * 0.5 - (-0.1 * 1.0) = +0.05
# But moving from d=3 to d=2.5 gives:
#   Reward = -0.1 * 2.5 - (-0.1 * 3.0) = +0.05
# Same reward for same distance change regardless of state!
# This distorts value function and can change which action is optimal.
```

**Right Way**:
```python
# CORRECT: Potential-based shaping
def shaping(s, a, s_next):
    phi_s = -distance(s, goal)  # Potential = negative distance
    phi_s_next = -distance(s_next, goal)

    return gamma * phi_s_next - phi_s

# Moving from d=1 to d=0.5:
#   shaping = 0.99 * (-0.5) - (-1.0) = +0.495
# Moving from d=3 to d=2.5:
#   shaping = 0.99 * (-2.5) - (-3.0) = +0.475
# Slightly different, depends on state! Preserves policy.
```

### Using Potential-Based Shaping

```python
def compute_total_reward(s, a, s_next, env_reward, gamma=0.99):
    """
    Combine environment reward with potential-based shaping.

    Pattern: R_total = R_env + R_shaping
    """
    # 1. Get reward from environment
    task_reward = env_reward

    # 2. Compute potential-based shaping (safe to add)
    potential = -distance_to_goal(s_next)
    potential_prev = -distance_to_goal(s)
    shaping_reward = gamma * potential - potential_prev

    # 3. Combine
    total_reward = task_reward + shaping_reward

    return total_reward
```

---

## Part 3: Sparse vs Dense Rewards

### The Fundamental Tradeoff

| Aspect | Sparse Rewards | Dense Rewards |
|--------|---|---|
| **Credit Assignment** | Hard (credit window huge) | Easy (immediate feedback) |
| **Learning Speed** | Slow (few positive examples) | Fast (constant signal) |
| **Reward Hacking** | Less likely (fewer targets) | More likely (many targets to exploit) |
| **Convergence** | Can converge to suboptimal | May not converge if hacking |
| **Real-World** | Matches reality (goals sparse) | Artificial but helps learning |

### Decision Framework

**Use SPARSE when**:
- Task naturally has sparse rewards (goal-reaching, game win/loss)
- Episode short (< 20 steps)
- You want solution robust to reward hacking
- Final performance matters more than learning speed

**Use DENSE when**:
- Episode long (> 50 steps) and no natural sub-goals
- Learning speed critical (limited training budget)
- You can design safe auxiliary rewards
- You'll validate extensively against hacking

**Use HYBRID when**:
- Combine sparse task reward with dense shaping
- Example: +1 for reaching goal (sparse) + negative distance shaping (dense)
- This is the most practical approach for long-horizon tasks

### Design Pattern: Sparse Task + Dense Shaping

```python
def reward_function(s, a, s_next, done):
    """
    Standard pattern: sparse task reward + potential-based shaping.

    This gets the best of both worlds:
    - Sparse task reward prevents hacking on main objective
    - Dense shaping prevents credit assignment crisis
    """
    # 1. Sparse task reward (what we truly care about)
    if goal_reached(s_next):
        task_reward = 1.0
    else:
        task_reward = 0.0

    # 2. Dense potential-based shaping (helps learning)
    gamma = 0.99
    phi_s = -np.linalg.norm(s['position'] - s['goal'])
    phi_s_next = -np.linalg.norm(s_next['position'] - s_next['goal'])
    shaping_reward = gamma * phi_s_next - phi_s

    # 3. Combine: Sparse main objective + dense guidance
    total = task_reward + 0.1 * shaping_reward
    # Scale shaping (0.1) relative to task (1.0) so task dominates

    return total
```

### Validation: Confirming Sparse/Dense Choice

```python
def validate_reward_choice(sparse_reward_fn, dense_reward_fn, env, n_trials=10):
    """
    Compare sparse vs dense by checking:
    1. Learning speed (how fast does agent improve?)
    2. Final performance (does dense cause hacking?)
    3. Stability (does one diverge?)
    """
    results = {
        'sparse': train_agent(sparse_reward_fn, env, n_trials),
        'dense': train_agent(dense_reward_fn, env, n_trials)
    }

    # Check learning curves
    print("Sparse learning speed:", results['sparse']['steps_to_50pct'])
    print("Dense learning speed:", results['dense']['steps_to_50pct'])

    # Check if dense causes hacking
    print("Sparse final score:", results['sparse']['final_score'])
    print("Dense final score:", results['dense']['final_score'])

    # If dense learned faster AND achieved same/higher score: use dense + validation
    # If sparse achieved higher: reward hacking detected in dense
```

## Part 4: Reward Hacking - Patterns and Detection

### Common Hacking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Shortcut Exploitation

Agent finds unintended path to success.

**Example (Quadruped)**:
- Task: Walk forward 10 meters
- Intended: Gait pattern that moves forward
- Hack: Agent learns to flip upside down (center of mass moves forward during flip!)

**Detection**:
```python
# Test on distribution shift
if test_on_different_terrain(agent) << train_performance:
    print("ALERT: Shortcut exploitation detected")
    print("Agent doesn't generalize → learned specific trick")
```

**Prevention**:
```python
def robust_reward(s, a, s_next):
    # Forward progress
    progress = s_next['x'] - s['x']

    # Requirement: Stay upright (prevents flipping hack)
    upright_penalty = -1.0 if not is_upright(s_next) else 0.0

    # Requirement: Reasonable movement (prevents wiggling)
    movement_penalty = -0.1 * np.sum(a**2)

    return progress + upright_penalty + movement_penalty
```

#### Pattern 2: Reward Signal Exploitation

Agent exploits direct reward signal rather than task.

**Example (Oscillation)**:
- Task: Balance pole in center
- Intended: Keep pole balanced
- Hack: Agent oscillates rapidly (each oscillation = +1 reward per step)

**Detection**:
```python
def detect_oscillation(trajectory):
    positions = [s['pole_angle'] for s in trajectory]
    # Count zero crossings
    crossings = sum(1 for i in range(len(positions)-1)
                    if positions[i] * positions[i+1] < 0)

    if crossings > len(trajectory) / 3:
        print("ALERT: Oscillation detected")
```

**Prevention**:
```python
def non_hackable_reward(s, a, s_next):
    # Task: Balanced pole
    balance_penalty = -(s_next['pole_angle']**2)  # Reward being centered

    # Prevent oscillation
    angle_velocity = s_next['pole_angle'] - s['pole_angle']
    oscillation_penalty = -0.1 * abs(angle_velocity)

    return balance_penalty + oscillation_penalty
```

#### Pattern 3: Unbounded Reward Exploitation

Agent maximizes dimension without bound.

**Example (Camera Hack)**:
- Task: Detect object (reward for correct detection)
- Hack: Agent learns to point camera lens at bright light source (always triggers detection)

**Detection**:
```python
def detect_unbounded_exploitation(training_history):
    rewards = training_history['episode_returns']

    # Check if rewards growing without bound
    if rewards[-100:].mean() >> rewards[100:200].mean():
        print("ALERT: Rewards diverging")
        print("Possible unbounded exploitation")
```

**Prevention**:
```python
# Use reward clipping
def clipped_reward(r):
    return np.clip(r, -1.0, 1.0)

# Or normalize
def normalized_reward(r, running_mean, running_std):
    r_norm = (r - running_mean) / (running_std + 1e-8)
    return np.clip(r_norm, -1.0, 1.0)
```

### Systematic Hacking Detection Framework

```python
def check_for_hacking(agent, train_env, test_envs, holdout_env):
    """
    Comprehensive hacking detection.
    """
    # 1. Distribution shift test
    train_perf = evaluate(agent, train_env)
    test_perf = evaluate(agent, test_envs)  # Variations of train

    if train_perf >> test_perf:
        print("HACKING: Agent doesn't generalize to distribution shift")
        return "shortcut_exploitation"

    # 2. Behavioral inspection
    trajectory = run_episode(agent, holdout_env)
    if has_suspicious_pattern(trajectory):
        print("HACKING: Suspicious behavior detected")
        return "pattern_exploitation"

    # 3. Reward curve analysis
    if rewards_diverging(agent.training_history):
        print("HACKING: Unbounded reward exploitation")
        return "reward_signal_exploitation"

    return "no_obvious_hacking"
```

---

## Part 5: Auxiliary Rewards and Shaping Examples

### Example 1: Distance-Based Shaping

**Most common shaping pattern. Safe when done with potential-based formula.**

```python
def distance_shaping(s, a, s_next, gamma=0.99):
    """
    Reward agent for getting closer to goal.

    CRITICAL: Use potential-based formula to preserve optimal policy.
    """
    goal_position = s['goal']
    curr_pos = s['position']
    next_pos = s_next['position']

    # Potential function: negative distance
    phi = -np.linalg.norm(curr_pos - goal_position)
    phi_next = -np.linalg.norm(next_pos - goal_position)

    # Potential-based shaping (preserves optimal policy)
    shaping_reward = gamma * phi_next - phi

    return shaping_reward
```

### Example 2: Auxiliary Smoothness Reward

**Help agent learn smooth actions without changing optimal behavior.**

```python
def smoothness_shaping(a, a_prev):
    """
    Penalize jittery/jerky actions.
    Helps with efficiency and generalization.
    """
    # Difference between consecutive actions
    action_jerk = np.linalg.norm(a - a_prev)

    # Penalty (small, doesn't dominate task reward)
    smoothness_penalty = -0.01 * action_jerk

    return smoothness_penalty
```

### Example 3: Energy/Control Efficiency

**Encourage efficient control.**

```python
def efficiency_reward(a):
    """
    Penalize excessive control effort.
    Makes solutions more robust.
    """
    # L2 norm of action (total control magnitude)
    effort = np.sum(a**2)

    # Small penalty
    return -0.001 * effort
```

### Example 4: Staying Safe Reward

**Prevent dangerous states (without hard constraints).**

```python
def safety_reward(s):
    """
    Soft penalty for dangerous states.
    Better than hard constraints (more learnable).
    """
    danger_score = 0.0

    # Example: Prevent collision
    min_clearance = np.min(s['collision_distances'])
    if min_clearance < 0.1:
        danger_score += 10.0 * (0.1 - min_clearance)

    # Example: Prevent extreme states
    if np.abs(s['position']).max() > 5.0:
        danger_score += 1.0

    return -danger_score
```

### When to Add Auxiliary Rewards

**Add auxiliary reward if**:
- It's potential-based (safe)
- Task reward already roughly works (agent > 10% success)
- Auxiliary targets clear sub-goals
- You validate with/without

**Don't add if**:
- Task reward doesn't work at all (fix that first)
- Creates new exploitation opportunities
- Makes reward engineering too complex

## Part 6: Inverse RL - Learning Rewards from Demonstrations

### The Problem

You have expert demonstrations but no explicit reward function. How to learn?

**Options**:
1. Behavioral cloning: Copy actions directly (doesn't learn why)
2. Reward learning (inverse RL): Infer reward structure from demonstrations
3. Imitation learning: Match expert behavior distribution (GAIL style)

### Inverse RL Concept

**Idea**: Expert is optimal under some reward function. Infer what reward structure makes expert optimal.

```
Expert demonstrations → Infer reward function → Train agent on learned reward
```

**Key insight**: If expert is optimal under reward R, then R(expert_actions) >> R(other_actions)

### Practical Inverse RL (Maximum Entropy IRL)

```python
class InverseRLLearner:
    """
    Learn reward function from expert demonstrations.

    Assumes expert is performing near-optimal policy under true reward.
    """

    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        # Reward function (small neural network)
        self.reward_net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim + action_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 1)
        )
        self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.reward_net.parameters())

    def compute_reward(self, s, a):
        """Learned reward function."""
        sa = torch.cat([torch.tensor(s), torch.tensor(a)])
        return self.reward_net(sa).item()

    def train_step(self, expert_trajectories, agent_trajectories):
        """
        Update reward to make expert better than agent.

        Principle: Maximize expert returns, minimize agent returns under current reward.
        """
        # Expert reward sum
        expert_returns = sum(
            sum(self.compute_reward(s, a) for s, a in traj)
            for traj in expert_trajectories
        )

        # Agent reward sum
        agent_returns = sum(
            sum(self.compute_reward(s, a) for s, a in traj)
            for traj in agent_trajectories
        )

        # Loss: Want expert >> agent
        loss = agent_returns - expert_returns

        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()

        return loss.item()
```

### When to Use Inverse RL

**Use when**:
- Reward is hard to specify but easy to demonstrate
- You have expert demonstrations (human, reference controller)
- Task complex enough that behavior != objective
- Training budget allows for two-stage process

**Don't use when**:
- Reward is easy to specify (just specify it!)
- No expert demonstrations available
- Demonstration quality varies
- Need fast learning (inverse RL is slow)

## Part 7: Reward Normalization and Clipping

### Why Normalize?

Reward scale directly affects gradient magnitude and training stability.

```python
# Without normalization
reward_taskA = 1000 * task_metric  # Large magnitude
loss = -policy_gradient * reward_taskA  # Huge gradients

# With normalization
reward_normalized = reward_taskA / reward_std  # Unit magnitude
loss = -policy_gradient * reward_normalized  # Reasonable gradients
```

### Standard Normalization Pipeline

```python
class RewardNormalizer:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=1e-8):
        self.mean = 0.0
        self.var = 1.0
        self.epsilon = epsilon

    def update_statistics(self, rewards):
        """Update running mean and variance."""
        rewards = np.array(rewards)
        # Exponential moving average (online update)
        alpha = 0.01
        self.mean = (1 - alpha) * self.mean + alpha * rewards.mean()
        self.var = (1 - alpha) * self.var + alpha * rewards.var()

    def normalize(self, reward):
        """Apply standardization then clipping."""
        # 1. Standardize (zero mean, unit variance)
        normalized = (reward - self.mean) / np.sqrt(self.var + self.epsilon)

        # 2. Clip to [-1, 1] for stability
        clipped = np.clip(normalized, -1.0, 1.0)

        return clipped
```

### Clipping Strategy

```python
def clip_reward(r, clip_range=(-1.0, 1.0)):
    """
    Clip reward to fixed range.

    Prevents large reward spikes from destabilizing training.
    """
    return np.clip(r, clip_range[0], clip_range[1])

# Usage
def total_reward(task_r, shaping_r):
    # Combine rewards
    combined = task_r + shaping_r

    # Clip combined
    clipped = clip_reward(combined)

    return clipped
```

---

## Part 8: Validating Reward Functions

### Validation Checklist

```python
def validate_reward_function(reward_fn, env, agent_class, n_trials=5):
    """
    Systematic validation of reward design.
    """
    results = {}

    # 1. Learning speed test
    agent = train_agent(agent_class, env, reward_fn, steps=100000)
    success_rate = evaluate(agent, env, n_episodes=100)
    results['learning_speed'] = success_rate

    if success_rate < 0.3:
        print("WARNING: Agent can't learn → reward signal too sparse")
        return False

    # 2. Generalization test
    test_variants = [modify_env(env) for _ in range(5)]
    test_rates = [evaluate(agent, test_env, 20) for test_env in test_variants]

### Red Flags During Validation

| Red Flag | Likely Cause | Fix |
|----------|---|---|
| Success rate < 10% after 50k steps | Reward too sparse | Add shaping |
| High variance across seeds | Reward scale/noise | Normalize/clip |
| Passes train but fails test | Reward hacking | Add anti-hacking penalties |
| Rewards diverging to infinity | Unbounded reward | Use clipping |
| Agent oscillates/twitches | Per-step reward exploitation | Penalize action change |
| Learning suddenly stops | Reward scale issue | Check normalization |

## Part 9: Common Pitfalls and Rationalizations

### Pitfall 1: "Let me just add distance reward"
**Rationalization**: "I'll add reward for getting closer to goal, it can't hurt"
**Problem**: Without potential-based formula, changes optimal policy
**Reality Check**: Measure policy difference with/without shaping

### Pitfall 2: "Sparse rewards are always better"
**Rationalization**: "Sparse rewards prevent hacking"
**Problem**: Agent can't learn in long-horizon tasks (credit assignment crisis)
**Reality Check**: 10+ steps without reward → need shaping or fail training

### Pitfall 3: "Normalize everything"
**Rationalization**: "I'll normalize all rewards to [-1, 1]"
**Problem**: Over-normalization loses task structure (goal vs near-goal now equal)
**Reality Check**: Validate that normalized reward still trains well

### Pitfall 4: "Inverse RL is the answer"
**Rationalization**: "I don't know how to specify rewards, I'll learn from demos"
**Problem**: Inverse RL is slow and requires good demonstrations
**Reality Check**: If you can specify reward clearly, just do it

### Pitfall 5: "More auxiliary rewards = faster learning"
**Rationalization**: "I'll add smoothness, energy, safety rewards"
**Problem**: Each auxiliary reward is another hacking target
**Reality Check**: Validate each auxiliary independently

### Pitfall 6: "This should work, why doesn't it?"
**Rationalization**: "The reward looks right, must be algorithm issue"
**Problem**: Reward design is usually the bottleneck, not algorithm
**Reality Check**: Systematically validate reward using test framework

### Pitfall 7: "Agent learned the task, my reward was right"
**Rationalization**: "Agent succeeded, so reward design was good"
**Problem**: Agent might succeed on hacked solution, not true task
**Reality Check**: Test on distribution shift / different environment variants

### Pitfall 8: "Dense rewards cause overfitting"
**Rationalization**: "Sparse rewards generalize better"
**Problem**: Sparse rewards just fail to learn in long episodes
**Reality Check**: Compare learning curves and final policy generalization

### Pitfall 9: "Clipping breaks the signal"
**Rationalization**: "If I clip rewards, I lose information"
**Problem**: Unbounded rewards cause training instability
**Reality Check**: Relative ordering preserved after clipping, information retained

### Pitfall 10: "Potential-based shaping doesn't matter"
**Rationalization**: "A reward penalty is a reward penalty"
**Problem**: Non-potential-based shaping CAN change optimal policy
**Reality Check**: Prove mathematically that Φ(s') - Φ(s) structure used

## Part 10: Reward Engineering Patterns for Common Tasks

### Pattern 1: Goal-Reaching Tasks

```python
def reaching_reward(s, a, s_next, gamma=0.99):
    """
    Task: Reach target location.
    """
    goal = s['goal']

    # Sparse task reward
    if np.linalg.norm(s_next['position'] - goal) < 0.1:
        task_reward = 1.0
    else:
        task_reward = 0.0

    # Dense potential-based shaping
    distance = np.linalg.norm(s_next['position'] - goal)
    distance_prev = np.linalg.norm(s['position'] - goal)

    phi = -distance
    phi_prev = -distance_prev
    shaping = gamma * phi - phi_prev

    # Efficiency penalty (optional)
    efficiency = -0.001 * np.sum(a**2)

    return task_reward + 0.1 * shaping + efficiency
```

### Pattern 2: Locomotion Tasks

```python
def locomotion_reward(s, a, s_next):
    """
    Task: Move forward efficiently.
    """
    # Forward progress (sparse)
    forward_reward = s_next['x_pos'] - s['x_pos']

    # Staying alive (don't fall)
    alive_bonus = 1.0 if is_alive(s_next) else 0.0

    # Energy efficiency
    action_penalty = -0.0001 * np.sum(a**2)

    return forward_reward + alive_bonus + action_penalty
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Objective Tasks

```python
def multi_objective_reward(s, a, s_next):
    """
    Task: Multiple objectives (e.g., reach goal AND minimize energy).
    """
    goal_reward = 10.0 * (goal_progress(s, s_next))
    energy_reward = -0.01 * np.sum(a**2)
    safety_reward = -1.0 * collision_risk(s_next)

    # Weight objectives
    return 1.0 * goal_reward + 0.1 * energy_reward + 0.5 * safety_reward
```

## Summary: Reward Engineering Workflow

1. **Specify what success looks like** (task reward)
2. **Choose sparse or dense** based on episode length
3. **If dense, use potential-based shaping** (preserves policy)
4. **Add anti-hacking penalties** if needed
5. **Normalize and clip** for stability
6. **Validate** systematically (generalization, hacking, stability)
7. **Iterate** based on validation results

---

## Key Equations Reference

```
Potential-Based Shaping:
F(s,a,s') = γΦ(s') - Φ(s)

Value Function Shift (with shaping):
V'(s) = V(s) + Φ(s)

Optimal Policy Preservation:
argmax_a Q'(s,a) = argmax_a Q(s,a)  (same action, different Q-values)

Reward Normalization:
r_norm = (r - μ) / (σ + ε)

Clipping:
r_clipped = clip(r_norm, -1, 1)
```

- [ ] Tested on distribution shift (different env variant)
- [ ] Behavioral inspection (is agent doing what you expect?)
- [ ] Training stability across seeds (variance < 0.3)
- [ ] Learning curves look reasonable (no sudden divergence)
- [ ] Final policy generalizes to test distribution
