# Experiment Tracking and Versioning Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you observe these symptoms:

**Reproducibility Symptoms:**
- Cannot reproduce a good result from last week (which hyperparameters?)
- Someone asks "which model is in production?" and you do not know
- Lost track of which data version produced which model
- Experiments tracked in spreadsheets or text files (manual, error-prone)

**Collaboration Symptoms:**
- Multiple people running experiments, no central tracking
- Cannot compare runs across team members
- Lost experiments when someone leaves the team
- No visibility into what others are trying

**Production Symptoms:**
- Cannot trace predictions back to model version and training data
- Need to roll back model but do not know which previous version was good
- Compliance requires audit trail (data → model → predictions)
- Cannot A/B test models because tracking unclear

**When NOT to use this skill:**
- Single experiment, one-off analysis (no need for tracking infrastructure)
- Prototyping where reproducibility not yet important
- Already have robust experiment tracking system working well

## Core Principle

**If you cannot reproduce it, it does not exist.**

Experiment tracking captures everything needed to reproduce a result:
- **Code version** (git commit hash)
- **Data version** (dataset hash, version tag)
- **Hyperparameters** (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- **Environment** (Python version, library versions)
- **Random seeds** (for deterministic results)
- **Metrics** (accuracy, loss over time)
- **Artifacts** (model checkpoints, predictions)

**Formula:** Good tracking = Code + Data + Config + Environment + Seeds + Metrics + Artifacts

The skill is building a system where **every experiment is automatically reproducible**.

## Part 1: RED - Without Experiment Tracking (5 Failures)

### Failure 1: Cannot Reproduce Best Run

**Scenario:** Training image classifier, got 94.2% accuracy last week. Today, best is 91.8%. Cannot figure out what changed.

**Without tracking:**

```python
# train_model.py - NO TRACKING VERSION

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms, models

def train_model():
    """
    Train model with no experiment tracking.

    FAILURE MODE: Cannot reproduce results.
    - Hyperparameters hardcoded or in head
    - No record of what produced 94.2% accuracy
    - Changed learning rate? batch size? data augmentation?
    - Lost forever if not documented manually
    """
    # Load data (which version? unknown)
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),  # Did we use this before?
        transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),  # What padding last time?
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
    ])

    train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(
        root='./data',
        train=True,
        download=True,
        transform=transform
    )

    # Hyperparameters (were these the good ones?)
    batch_size = 128  # Or was it 64? 256?
    learning_rate = 0.001  # Or 0.01? 0.0001?
    epochs = 50  # Or 100?

    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

    # Model (which architecture exactly?)
    model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)  # Was it pretrained=True or False?
    model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 10)

    # Optimizer (which one? what momentum?)
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
        model.parameters(),
        lr=learning_rate,
        momentum=0.9  # Or 0.95?
    )

    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for data, target in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data)
            loss = criterion(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        # Print loss to terminal (lost after terminal closes)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss.item()}")

    # Save model (no version information)
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_best.pth')  # Overwrites previous best!

    print("Training complete")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    train_model()
```

**Problems:**
- No record of hyperparameters that produced 94.2% accuracy
- Cannot compare current run to previous runs
- Terminal output lost after closing
- Manual notes (if any) error-prone and incomplete
- model_best.pth gets overwritten (lost previous version)

**Impact:** Wasted hours trying to reproduce good result. May never find it again.

---

### Failure 2: No Model Versioning (Which Model in Production?)

**Scenario:** Bug report from production. Customer service asks "which model is deployed?" No clear answer.

**Without versioning:**

```python
# deploy_model.py - NO VERSIONING

import torch
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

def deploy_model():
    """
    Deploy model without versioning.

    FAILURE MODE: Cannot identify which model is where.
    - No semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
    - No metadata (when trained, on what data, by whom)
    - Cannot tell if production model is same as local model
    - Cannot roll back to previous version
    """
    # Which model file? (multiple candidates)
    model_candidates = [
        'model_best.pth',       # Best on validation set
        'model_final.pth',      # Last epoch
        'model_checkpoint.pth', # Some checkpoint
        'model_old.pth',        # Backup?
    ]

    # Pick one (guess which is best?)
    model_path = 'model_best.pth'

    # Copy to production (no version tag)
    production_path = '/models/production/model.pth'
    shutil.copy(model_path, production_path)

    # No metadata
    # - When was this model trained?
    # - What accuracy does it have?
    # - What data was it trained on?
    # - Can we roll back?

    print(f"Deployed {model_path} to production")
    # But wait... which exact version is this?
    # If there's a bug, how do we identify it?

def rollback_model():
    """
    Try to roll back model.

    FAILURE MODE: No previous versions saved.
    """
    # There's only one production model file
    # Previous version was overwritten
    # Cannot roll back!

    print("ERROR: No previous version to roll back to")

# Questions we cannot answer:
# 1. Which model version is in production?
# 2. When was it deployed?
# 3. What accuracy does it have?
# 4. What data was it trained on?
# 5. Can we compare to previous versions?
# 6. Can we roll back if needed?
```

**Problems:**
- No way to identify which model version is deployed
- Cannot roll back to previous version (overwritten)
- No metadata (accuracy, training date, data version)
- Audit trail missing (compliance issue)
- Cannot A/B test (need multiple tagged versions)

**Impact:** Production incident, cannot identify or rollback problematic model. Hours of debugging.

---

### Failure 3: Manual Artifact Management (Files Everywhere)

**Scenario:** Running multiple experiments, artifacts scattered across directories. Cannot find the model checkpoint from experiment 42.

**Without artifact management:**

```python
# experiment_runner.py - NO ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT

import os
import torch
from datetime import datetime

class ExperimentRunner:
    """
    Run experiments with manual file management.

    FAILURE MODE: Files scattered everywhere.
    - No consistent naming convention
    - No organization by experiment
    - Cannot find specific checkpoint
    - Disk space wasted on duplicates
    """

    def __init__(self, experiment_name):
        self.experiment_name = experiment_name

        # Where do files go? (inconsistent across experiments)
        self.save_dir = f"./experiments/{experiment_name}/"
        os.makedirs(self.save_dir, exist_ok=True)

    def save_checkpoint(self, model, epoch, metrics):
        """
        Save checkpoint with unclear naming.

        PROBLEMS:
        - Filename not descriptive (which epoch? which metrics?)
        - No metadata saved with checkpoint
        - Hard to find best checkpoint later
        """
        # Bad filename (not descriptive)
        filename = f"checkpoint_{epoch}.pth"
        path = os.path.join(self.save_dir, filename)

        torch.save(model.state_dict(), path)

        # Metrics not saved! (only in terminal)
        print(f"Saved checkpoint to {path}")

    def save_predictions(self, predictions, split):
        """Save predictions (no link to model version)."""
        filename = f"predictions_{split}.npy"
        path = os.path.join(self.save_dir, filename)

        import numpy as np
        np.save(path, predictions)

        # PROBLEM: Cannot trace predictions back to model version
        # If we have 10 prediction files, which model generated which?

# Result after 50 experiments:
# ./experiments/
#   exp1/
#     checkpoint_10.pth
#     checkpoint_20.pth
#     predictions_val.npy
#   exp2/
#     checkpoint_50.pth  (wait, is this epoch 50 or checkpoint index 50?)
#     model_best.pth
#     predictions.npy     (which split? val or test?)
#   exp3/
#     model_final.pth
#     model_best.pth      (which is actually best?)
#     checkpoint_100.pth
#     old_checkpoint.pth  (what is this?)
#   ...
#   exp50/
#     (where is exp42? deleted by accident?)

# Questions we cannot answer:
# 1. Which checkpoint has best validation accuracy?
# 2. Which experiment produced predictions_val.npy?
# 3. How much disk space are we wasting?
# 4. Can we safely delete old checkpoints?
# 5. How do we reproduce experiment 42?
```

**Problems:**
- Inconsistent file naming across experiments
- No metadata linking artifacts to runs
- Cannot find specific checkpoint without manual search
- Disk space wasted (no automatic cleanup)
- Artifacts lost when directories deleted

**Impact:** Hours wasted searching for files, confusion about which artifact is which.

---

### Failure 4: No Lineage Tracking (Data → Model → Predictions)

**Scenario:** Model performance degraded in production. Need to trace back: which data was used? Cannot reconstruct lineage.

**Without lineage tracking:**

```python
# production_pipeline.py - NO LINEAGE TRACKING

import torch
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

def production_pipeline():
    """
    Run production pipeline without lineage tracking.

    FAILURE MODE: Cannot trace predictions to source.
    - Which data version was used?
    - Which model version made predictions?
    - Can we reproduce these predictions?
    - What if data or model changed?
    """
    # Load data (which version?)
    data = pd.read_csv('data/production_data.csv')  # File gets overwritten daily!

    # Preprocess (what transformations?)
    # ... (transformations not logged)

    # Load model (which version?)
    model = torch.load('models/production/model.pth')  # No version info!

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model(data)

    # Save predictions (no lineage)
    predictions.to_csv('predictions/output.csv')  # Overwrites previous!

    # No record of:
    # - Which data file (version, hash, timestamp)
    # - Which model version (training run, accuracy, date)
    # - Which preprocessing (code version, parameters)
    # - Link between predictions and inputs

# Questions we cannot answer when predictions are wrong:
# 1. Which data was used? (data/production_data.csv changes daily)
# 2. Which model version? (models/production/model.pth changes weekly)
# 3. Can we reproduce? (no record of inputs, model, or preprocessing)
# 4. When did model last change? (no audit log)
# 5. What was prediction quality? (no metrics logged)

class DataVersionTracker:
    """
    Attempt to track data versions manually.

    FAILURE MODE: Manual tracking is incomplete and error-prone.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.versions = {}  # In-memory only (lost on restart)

    def track_data(self, data_path):
        """Track data version manually."""
        import hashlib

        # Compute hash (expensive for large files)
        with open(data_path, 'rb') as f:
            file_hash = hashlib.md5(f.read()).hexdigest()

        # Store in memory (lost when process ends)
        self.versions[data_path] = {
            'hash': file_hash,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        }

        # NOT PERSISTED! Lost on restart.
        # NOT LINKED to model or predictions

        return file_hash

# Manual tracking fails because:
# - Easy to forget to call track_data()
# - Data not automatically linked to models
# - Metadata lost when process ends
# - No visualization or query interface
```

**Problems:**
- Cannot trace predictions back to data and model versions
- No automatic lineage capture (manual = unreliable)
- Compliance issues (cannot prove which data produced which predictions)
- Cannot reproduce production results
- Debugging production issues requires guesswork

**Impact:** Production debugging nightmare. May violate compliance requirements. Cannot reproduce issues.

---

### Failure 5: Cannot Compare Runs

**Scenario:** Tried 20 different hyperparameter settings. Which one was best? Need to manually check 20 log files.

**Without run comparison:**

```python
# hyperparameter_search.py - NO RUN COMPARISON

import torch
import itertools
from datetime import datetime

def hyperparameter_search():
    """
    Search hyperparameters without tracking.

    FAILURE MODE: Cannot compare runs systematically.
    - Results printed to terminal (lost)
    - No structured storage of metrics
    - Cannot sort by metric
    - Cannot visualize trends
    """
    # Hyperparameter grid
    learning_rates = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
    batch_sizes = [32, 64, 128]
    optimizers = ['sgd', 'adam']

    # Try all combinations
    for lr, bs, opt in itertools.product(learning_rates, batch_sizes, optimizers):
        print(f"\n{'='*50}")
        print(f"Running: LR={lr}, BS={bs}, Optimizer={opt}")
        print(f"{'='*50}")

        # Train model
        model = train_model_with_params(lr, bs, opt)

        # Evaluate
        accuracy = evaluate_model(model)

        # Print results (LOST after terminal closes)
        print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

        # Maybe save to file? (manual, error-prone)
        with open('results.txt', 'a') as f:  # Append to text file
            f.write(f"{lr},{bs},{opt},{accuracy}\n")

    print("\nSearch complete! Now manually parse results.txt to find best...")

# After 20 runs, results.txt looks like:
# 0.001,32,sgd,0.8234
# 0.001,32,adam,0.8456
# 0.001,64,sgd,0.8312
# ...
#
# Questions we cannot answer easily:
# 1. Which hyperparameters gave best accuracy?
#    (need to manually parse and sort)
# 2. How did accuracy change over epochs?
#    (not logged per-epoch)
# 3. Which optimizer works best for each learning rate?
#    (need to write custom analysis script)
# 4. Any correlation between batch size and accuracy?
#    (need to create scatter plots manually)
# 5. Can we visualize learning curves?
#    (would need to log per-epoch, plot manually)

def analyze_results_manually():
    """Manually analyze results from text file."""
    import pandas as pd

    # Parse text file (fragile)
    df = pd.read_csv('results.txt',
                     names=['lr', 'bs', 'opt', 'acc'],
                     header=None)

    # Find best (simple)
    best = df.loc[df['acc'].idxmax()]
    print(f"Best: LR={best['lr']}, BS={best['bs']}, Opt={best['opt']}, Acc={best['acc']}")

    # But cannot:
    # - See learning curves (not logged)
    # - Compare training time (not logged)
    # - Check if overfit (no validation metrics)
    # - Reproduce best run (hyperparameters not complete)
    # - Share results with team (no web UI)
```

**Problems:**
- Results scattered across terminal output and text files
- Cannot easily compare metrics across runs
- No visualization (learning curves, distributions)
- Cannot filter/sort runs by metric
- No structured query interface
- Results not shareable (text files, not web UI)

**Impact:** Wasted time manually parsing logs. Cannot make data-driven decisions. Poor hyperparameter selection.

---

### RED Summary: The Cost of No Tracking

**Time wasted per week:**
- Searching for lost experiments: 2-4 hours
- Manually comparing runs: 1-2 hours
- Reproducing previous results: 3-5 hours
- Identifying production models: 30-60 minutes
- Finding and organizing files: 1-2 hours

**Total:** 7.5-13.5 hours per week wasted on manual tracking

**Risks:**
- Cannot reproduce published results (reputation damage)
- Cannot identify production models (compliance violation)
- Lost best experiments (wasted training cost)
- Team confusion (duplicated effort)
- Production incidents (no rollback capability)

**The problem:** Without systematic tracking, ML development becomes archaeology. You spend more time searching for what you did than doing new work.

**Example failure cascade:**

```python
# Day 1: Train model, get 96.5% accuracy
# "I'll remember these hyperparameters"

# Day 7: Try to reproduce
# "Was it learning_rate=0.01 or 0.001?"
# "Did I use pretrained=True?"
# "Which data augmentation did I use?"

# Day 30: Someone asks "what's your best accuracy?"
# "I think it was 96.5%... or was it 94.5%?"
# "Let me search my terminal history..."
# "Oops, I cleared it last week"

# Day 90: Paper deadline
# "Claimed 96.5% in abstract"
# "Cannot reproduce, best now is 93.2%"
# "Withdraw paper or publish unreproducible results?"

# Day 180: Production incident
# "Which model version is deployed?"
# "model_best.pth was overwritten 5 times"
# "No idea which one is in production"
# "Cannot roll back, previous version lost"

# Total cost: Wasted weeks, damaged credibility, compliance risk
```

**Common excuses and why they fail:**

1. **"I'll write it down in a notebook"**
   - Reality: Notebooks get lost, incomplete, not searchable
   - What's missing: Automatic tracking, artifact links

2. **"I'll use descriptive filenames"**
   - Reality: model_lr0.01_bs128_acc94.2.pth grows to 50+ files
   - What's missing: Metadata, comparison UI, version history

3. **"I'll commit to git"**
   - Reality: Git not designed for large model files
   - What's missing: Model versioning, metric tracking, visualization

4. **"I'll remember important experiments"**
   - Reality: Memory fades, especially after 100+ experiments
   - What's missing: Durable, searchable record

5. **"It's just me, don't need formal tracking"**
   - Reality: Future you is a different person who forgot past you's decisions
   - What's missing: Documentation for future self

**The solution:** Systematic experiment tracking (MLflow, W&B) makes reproducibility automatic instead of manual.

### Bonus RED Example: The Compliance Nightmare

**Scenario:** Regulated industry (healthcare, finance) requires full audit trail. Auditor asks: "For prediction made on patient X on 2025-10-15, prove which model version and data were used."

**Without tracking (compliance failure):**

```python
# production_inference.py - NO AUDIT TRAIL

def make_prediction(patient_data):
    """
    Make prediction without audit trail.

    COMPLIANCE VIOLATION:
    - Cannot prove which model was used
    - Cannot prove which data was used
    - Cannot reproduce prediction
    - No timestamp, no version, no lineage
    """
    # Load model (which version? when trained? by whom?)
    model = torch.load('production_model.pth')

    # Make prediction
    prediction = model(patient_data)

    # Save result (no audit metadata)
    save_to_database(patient_id, prediction)

    # MISSING:
    # - Model version ID
    # - Model training date
    # - Model accuracy on validation set
    # - Data preprocessing version
    # - Prediction timestamp
    # - Link to training run
    # - Link to data version

    return prediction

# Auditor questions we CANNOT answer:
# 1. "Which model version made this prediction?"
#    Answer: "We have model.pth but no version info"
#
# 2. "What was this model's validation accuracy?"
#    Answer: "Not sure, we didn't save that"
#
# 3. "Can you reproduce this exact prediction?"
#    Answer: "Maybe, if we still have the same model file"
#
# 4. "When was this model trained and by whom?"
#    Answer: "We'd have to check git logs and emails..."
#
# 5. "What data was this model trained on?"
#    Answer: "Probably the data in the data/ folder?"
#
# 6. "Has the model been updated since this prediction?"
#    Answer: "Yes, several times, but we overwrote the file"
#
# 7. "Show me the full lineage from training data to this prediction"
#    Answer: "We don't have that information"

# RESULT: Compliance violation, potential regulatory fine, project shutdown

def audit_trail_attempt():
    """
    Attempt to create audit trail manually.

    FAILURE: Manual tracking is incomplete and unreliable.
    """
    # Try to piece together audit trail after the fact
    audit_log = {

        'file_size': os.path.getsize('production_model.pth'),
        'file_modified': os.path.getmtime('production_model.pth'),

        # - No code version
        # - Timestamps are file system timestamps (unreliable)
    }

    # This audit trail is insufficient for compliance
    return audit_log

# Cost of compliance failure:
# - Regulatory fines: $100,000+
# - Project shutdown until compliant
# - Reputation damage
# - Legal liability
# - Cannot deploy to production in regulated industry

# The problem: Compliance requires proof, not promises.
# Manual tracking = no proof = compliance failure
```

**Problems:**
- No model version tracking (which exact model made prediction?)
- No lineage tracking (cannot trace back to training data)
- No audit timestamps (when was model trained, deployed, used?)
- No metadata (accuracy, training details, responsible party)
- Cannot reproduce predictions (no saved inputs, model version unclear)
- File overwrites destroy history (cannot recover previous versions)

**Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, potential fines, project cancellation, legal liability.

**The solution:** Experiment tracking with full lineage provides automatic compliance audit trail.

**Model registry benefits:**
- Clear versioning (v1, v2, v3)
- Staging workflow (dev → staging → production)
- Metadata tracking (accuracy, data version, etc.)
- Rollback capability (revert to previous version)
- Audit trail (who deployed what when)

---

### Solution 4: Data Versioning

**When to version data:**
- Dataset changes over time
- Need to reproduce experiments with exact data
- Large datasets (cannot commit to git)

**Option A: DVC (Data Version Control)**

```bash
# Install and setup DVC
pip install dvc

# Initialize DVC in project
dvc init

# Add dataset to DVC
dvc add data/cifar10

# Commit DVC metadata to git
git add data/cifar10.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Add CIFAR-10 v1.0"
git tag data-v1.0

# Push data to remote storage (S3, GCS, etc.)
dvc remote add storage s3://my-bucket/dvc-store
dvc push

# Team members pull data
dvc pull

# Checkout specific version
git checkout data-v1.0
dvc checkout
```

**Option B: Hash-Based Versioning**

```python
# Simpler: Just compute and log data hash
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path

def compute_data_hash(data_path: Path) -> str:
    """Compute dataset hash for versioning."""
    hash_md5 = hashlib.md5()
    for file_path in sorted(data_path.rglob('*')):
        if file_path.is_file():
            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
                for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
                    hash_md5.update(chunk)
    return hash_md5.hexdigest()

# In training code
data_hash = compute_data_hash(Path('./data/cifar10'))
mlflow.log_param('data_hash', data_hash)  # Track data version
```

**Data versioning benefits:**
- Reproduce experiments with exact data
- Detect when data changes affect metrics
- Sync datasets across team
- Compliance audit trail

---

### Solution 5: Lineage Tracking (Data → Model → Predictions)

**Lineage tracking solves:**
- Which data produced which model?
- Which model made which predictions?
- Can we reproduce production predictions?
- Compliance and audit trail

**Lineage tracking implementation:**

```python
# lineage_tracking.py - Track full pipeline lineage

### Solution 6: MLflow vs W&B Decision Matrix

**When to use MLflow:**
- Self-hosted infrastructure (data privacy, compliance)
- Single user or small team (< 5 people)
- Want open source solution (no vendor lock-in)
- Simple experiment tracking needs
- Have DevOps resources (can run server)

**When to use W&B:**
- Team collaboration (> 5 people)
- Want hosted solution (no server management)
- Need advanced visualization (parallel coordinates, 3D plots)
- Real-time monitoring during training
- Easy sharing with stakeholders (send link)

**When to use both:**
- MLflow for model registry (staging/production workflow)
- W&B for experiment tracking (better visualization)
- Best of both worlds (local registry + cloud tracking)

**Quick integration:**

```python
# Use both MLflow and W&B together
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    wandb.init(project="my-project", config=config)

    # Log to both
    mlflow.log_params(config)
    wandb.config.update(config)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        metrics = train_epoch()
        mlflow.log_metrics(metrics, step=epoch)
        wandb.log(metrics)

    # W&B for visualization, MLflow for registry
    mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "model-name")
    wandb.log_artifact("model.pth")
```

# Reproducibility checklist:
# ✅ Random seeds set (torch, numpy, random)
# ✅ CuDNN deterministic mode enabled
# ✅ Environment versions logged (Python, PyTorch, CUDA)
# ✅ Code version logged (git commit hash)
# ✅ Data version logged (dataset hash)
# ✅ Hyperparameters logged (all config)
# ✅ Model architecture logged
# ✅ Training procedure documented

# NOW ANY EXPERIMENT CAN BE REPRODUCED EXACTLY!

### REFACTOR Summary: Stress Testing Your Tracking

**All 10 pressure tests must pass:**

1. **Lost Experiment Recovery** - Find and reproduce best run from weeks ago
2. **Production Model ID** - Instantly identify which model is deployed
3. **Multi-User Comparison** - Compare runs across team members
4. **Data Change Detection** - Trace performance changes to data versions
5. **Model Rollback** - Revert production to previous version in <5 minutes
6. **Prediction Audit** - Full lineage from predictions to source
7. **Hyperparameter Search** - Analyze 100+ runs efficiently
8. **Long-term Reproducibility** - Reproduce results from 6+ months ago
9. **Artifact Cleanup** - Safely delete artifacts without losing important runs
10. **Team Onboarding** - New members understand past work in hours

**Common tracking failures that pressure tests catch:**

```python
# Failure 1: Incomplete logging
# SYMPTOM: Can find run but missing key parameters
mlflow.log_params({
    'learning_rate': 0.001,
    # MISSING: batch_size, optimizer, random_seed
})
# RESULT: Pressure Test 1 fails (cannot fully reproduce)

# Failure 2: No model registry
# SYMPTOM: Cannot identify production model
torch.save(model, 'production_model.pth')  # No versioning!
# RESULT: Pressure Test 2 fails (which version is this?)

# Failure 3: No data versioning
# SYMPTOM: Cannot correlate metric changes to data changes
mlflow.log_param('data_path', './data')  # Path, not version!
# RESULT: Pressure Test 4 fails (data changed, how to know?)

# Failure 4: No lineage tracking
# SYMPTOM: Cannot trace predictions to model/data
model.predict(data)
save_predictions('output.csv')  # No link to model version!
# RESULT: Pressure Test 6 fails (which model made these predictions?)

# Failure 5: No artifact retention policy
# SYMPTOM: Disk fills up, unclear what to delete
for i in range(100):
    mlflow.log_artifact(f'checkpoint_{i}.pth')  # All saved forever!
# RESULT: Pressure Test 9 fails (200GB of checkpoints, which are important?)
```

**Pressure test frequency:**

- **During development:** Run tests 1, 3, 7 daily (experiment recovery, comparison, search)
- **Before production deploy:** Run tests 2, 5, 6 (model ID, rollback, audit)
- **Monthly:** Run tests 4, 8, 9 (data changes, long-term repro, cleanup)
- **New hire:** Run test 10 (onboarding)

**Failure recovery:**

If pressure tests fail, fix tracking systematically:

```python
# Step 1: Add missing parameters
REQUIRED_PARAMS = [
    'learning_rate', 'batch_size', 'optimizer', 'random_seed',
    'git_commit', 'data_hash', 'model_architecture',
]

for param in REQUIRED_PARAMS:
    assert param in config, f"Missing required param: {param}"
    mlflow.log_param(param, config[param])

# Step 2: Enable model registry
mlflow.register_model(model_uri, model_name)

# Step 3: Version data with hash
data_hash = compute_hash(data_path)
mlflow.log_param('data_hash', data_hash)

# Step 4: Track lineage
mlflow.log_param('parent_run_id', training_run_id)  # Link inference to training

# Step 5: Implement artifact retention
if run_metric < top_5_threshold:
    # Don't log large artifacts for low-performing runs
    pass
```

**Success metrics:**

Your tracking is production-ready when:

- ✅ All 10 pressure tests pass
- ✅ Can reproduce any experiment from last 6 months in <10 minutes
- ✅ Can identify production model version in <30 seconds
- ✅ New team members productive in <4 hours (not <2 days)
- ✅ Disk usage under control (automatic cleanup)
- ✅ Zero compliance violations (full audit trail)
- ✅ Zero lost experiments (everything tracked)

**The test:** Can you go on vacation for 2 weeks and have team reproduce your best result? If no, tracking is incomplete.

## Part 4: Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: MLflow in Training Script

```python
# Minimal MLflow integration
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_params(config)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        train_loss, val_loss = train_epoch()
        mlflow.log_metrics({'train_loss': train_loss, 'val_loss': val_loss}, step=epoch)

    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
```

### Pattern 2: W&B in Training Loop

```python
# Minimal W&B integration
wandb.init(project="my-project", config=config)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    train_loss, val_loss = train_epoch()
    wandb.log({'train_loss': train_loss, 'val_loss': val_loss})

wandb.finish()
```

### Pattern 3: Hyperparameter Sweep

```python
# W&B hyperparameter sweep
sweep_config = {
    'method': 'random',
    'parameters': {
        'learning_rate': {'values': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]},
        'batch_size': {'values': [32, 64, 128]},
    }
}

sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config, project="my-project")
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=train_model, count=20)
```

## Skill Mastery Checklist

You have mastered experiment tracking when you can:

- [ ] Recognize when tracking is needed (cannot reproduce, lost experiments)
- [ ] Set up MLflow tracking server and UI
- [ ] Set up W&B account and project
- [ ] Instrument training code to log hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts
- [ ] Version models in model registry with staging labels
- [ ] Version datasets with DVC or hash-based tracking
- [ ] Implement lineage tracking (data → model → predictions)
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility (seeds, environment, code version)
- [ ] Choose between MLflow and W&B based on requirements
- [ ] Query tracking system to find best experiments
- [ ] Roll back production models when needed
- [ ] Audit predictions for compliance
- [ ] Onboard new team members using tracked experiments

**Key insight:** Without tracking, experiments are lost. With tracking, every experiment is reproducible and queryable. The skill is building systems where reproducibility is automatic, not manual.
