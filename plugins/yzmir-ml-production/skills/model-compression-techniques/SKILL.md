# Model Compression Techniques

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deploying models to edge devices (mobile, IoT, embedded systems)
- Model too large for deployment constraints (storage, memory, bandwidth)
- Inference costs too high (need smaller/faster model)
- Need to balance model size, speed, and accuracy
- Combining multiple compression techniques (quantization + pruning + distillation)

**When NOT to use:**
- Model already fits deployment constraints (compression unnecessary)
- Training optimization needed (use training-optimization pack instead)
- Quantization is sufficient (use quantization-for-inference instead)
- LLM-specific optimization (use llm-specialist for KV cache, speculative decoding)

**Relationship with quantization-for-inference:**
- Quantization: Reduce precision (FP32 → INT8/INT4) - 4× size reduction
- Compression: Reduce architecture (pruning, distillation) - 2-10× size reduction
- Often combined: Quantization + pruning + distillation = 10-50× total reduction

## Core Principle

**Compression is not one-size-fits-all. Architecture and deployment target determine technique.**

Without systematic compression:
- Mobile deployment: 440MB model crashes 2GB devices
- Wrong technique: Pruning transformers → 33pp accuracy drop
- Unstructured pruning: No speedup on standard hardware
- Aggressive distillation: 77× compression produces gibberish
- No recovery: 5pp preventable accuracy loss

**Formula:** Architecture analysis (transformer vs CNN) + Deployment constraints (hardware, latency, size) + Technique selection (pruning vs distillation) + Quality preservation (recovery, progressive compression) = Production-ready compressed model.

## Compression Decision Framework

```
Model Compression Decision Tree

1. What is target deployment?
   ├─ Edge/Mobile (strict size/memory) → Aggressive compression (4-10×)
   ├─ Cloud/Server (cost optimization) → Moderate compression (2-4×)
   └─ On-premises (moderate constraints) → Balanced approach

2. What is model architecture?
   ├─ Transformer (BERT, GPT, T5)
   │  └─ Primary: Knowledge distillation (preserves attention)
   │  └─ Secondary: Layer dropping, quantization
   │  └─ AVOID: Aggressive unstructured pruning (destroys quality)
   │
   ├─ CNN (ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet)
   │  └─ Primary: Structured channel pruning (works well)
   │  └─ Secondary: Quantization (INT8 standard)
   │  └─ Tertiary: Knowledge distillation (classification tasks)
   │
   └─ RNN/LSTM
      └─ Primary: Quantization (safe, effective)
      └─ Secondary: Structured pruning (hidden dimension)
      └─ AVOID: Unstructured pruning (breaks sequential dependencies)

3. What is deployment hardware?
   ├─ CPU/GPU/Mobile (standard) → Structured pruning (actual speedup)
   └─ Specialized (A100, sparse accelerators) → Unstructured pruning possible

4. What is acceptable quality loss?
   ├─ <2pp → Conservative: Quantization only (4× reduction)
   ├─ 2-5pp → Moderate: Quantization + structured pruning (6-10× reduction)
   └─ >5pp → Aggressive: Full pipeline with distillation (10-50× reduction)

5. Combine techniques for maximum compression:
   Quantization (4×) + Pruning (2×) + Distillation (2×) = 16× total reduction
```

## Part 1: Structured vs Unstructured Pruning

### When to Use Each

**Unstructured Pruning:**
- **Use when:** Sparse hardware available (NVIDIA A100, specialized accelerators)
- **Benefit:** Highest compression (70-90% sparsity possible)
- **Drawback:** No speedup on standard hardware (computes zeros anyway)
- **Hardware support:** Rare (most deployments use standard CPU/GPU)

**Structured Pruning:**
- **Use when:** Standard hardware (CPU, GPU, mobile) - 99% of deployments
- **Benefit:** Actual speedup (smaller dense matrices)
- **Drawback:** Lower compression ratio (50-70% typical)
- **Variants:** Channel pruning (CNNs), layer dropping (transformers), attention head pruning

### Structured Channel Pruning (CNNs)

**Problem:** Unstructured pruning creates sparse tensors that don't accelerate on standard hardware.

**Solution:** Remove entire channels to create smaller dense model (actual speedup).

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch_pruning as tp

def structured_channel_pruning_cnn(model, pruning_ratio=0.5, example_input=None):
    """
    Structured channel pruning for CNNs (actual speedup on all hardware).

    WHY structured: Removes entire channels/filters, creating smaller dense model
    WHY works: Smaller dense matrices compute faster than sparse matrices on standard hardware

    Args:
        model: CNN model to prune
        pruning_ratio: Fraction of channels to remove (0.5 = remove 50%)
        example_input: Example input tensor for tracing dependencies

    Returns:
        Pruned model (smaller, faster)
    """
    if example_input is None:
        example_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

    # Define importance metric (L1 norm of channels)
    # WHY L1 norm: Channels with small L1 norm contribute less to output
    importance = tp.importance.MagnitudeImportance(p=1)

    # Create pruner
    pruner = tp.pruner.MagnitudePruner(
        model,
        example_inputs=example_input,
        importance=importance,
        pruning_ratio=pruning_ratio,
        global_pruning=False  # Prune each layer independently
    )

    # Execute pruning (removes channels, creates smaller model)
    # WHY remove channels: Conv2d(64, 128) → Conv2d(32, 64) after 50% pruning
    pruner.step()

    return model

# Example: Prune ResNet18
from torchvision.models import resnet18

model = resnet18(pretrained=True)
print(f"Original model size: {get_model_size(model):.1f}MB")  # 44.7MB
print(f"Original params: {count_parameters(model):,}")  # 11,689,512

# Apply 50% channel pruning
model_pruned = structured_channel_pruning_cnn(
    model,
    pruning_ratio=0.5,
    example_input=torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
)

print(f"Pruned model size: {get_model_size(model_pruned):.1f}MB")  # 22.4MB (50% reduction)
print(f"Pruned params: {count_parameters(model_pruned):,}")  # 5,844,756 (50% reduction)

# Benchmark inference speed
# WHY faster: Smaller dense matrices (fewer FLOPs, less memory bandwidth)
original_time = benchmark_inference(model)  # 25ms
pruned_time = benchmark_inference(model_pruned)  # 12.5ms (2× FASTER!)

# Accuracy (before fine-tuning)
original_acc = evaluate(model)  # 69.8%
pruned_acc = evaluate(model_pruned)  # 64.2% (5.6pp drop - needs fine-tuning)

# Fine-tune to recover accuracy
fine_tune(model_pruned, epochs=5, lr=1e-4)
pruned_acc_recovered = evaluate(model_pruned)  # 68.5% (1.3pp drop, acceptable)
```

**Helper functions:**

```python
def get_model_size(model):
    """Calculate model size in MB."""
    # WHY: Multiply parameters by 4 bytes (FP32)
    param_size = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()) * 4 / (1024 ** 2)
    return param_size

def count_parameters(model):
    """Count trainable parameters."""
    return sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)

def benchmark_inference(model, num_runs=100):
    """Benchmark inference time (ms)."""
    import time
    model.eval()
    example_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

    # Warmup
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(10):
            model(example_input)

    # Benchmark
    start = time.time()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(num_runs):
            model(example_input)
    end = time.time()

    return (end - start) / num_runs * 1000  # Convert to ms
```

### Iterative Pruning (Quality Preservation)

**Problem:** Pruning all at once (50% in one step) → 10pp accuracy drop.

**Solution:** Iterative pruning (5 steps × 10% each) → 2pp accuracy drop.

```python
def iterative_pruning(model, target_ratio=0.5, num_iterations=5, finetune_epochs=2):
    """
    Iterative pruning with fine-tuning between steps.

    WHY iterative: Gradual pruning allows model to adapt
    WHY fine-tune: Remaining weights compensate for removed weights

    Example: 50% pruning
    - One-shot: 50% pruning → 10pp accuracy drop
    - Iterative: 5 steps × 10% each → 2pp accuracy drop (better!)

    Args:
        model: Model to prune
        target_ratio: Final pruning ratio (0.5 = remove 50% of weights)
        num_iterations: Number of pruning steps (more = gradual = better quality)
        finetune_epochs: Fine-tuning epochs after each step

    Returns:
        Pruned model with quality preservation
    """
    # Calculate pruning amount per iteration
    # WHY: Distribute total pruning across iterations
    amount_per_iteration = 1 - (1 - target_ratio) ** (1 / num_iterations)

    print(f"Pruning {target_ratio*100:.0f}% in {num_iterations} steps")
    print(f"Amount per step: {amount_per_iteration*100:.1f}%")

    for step in range(num_iterations):
        print(f"\n=== Iteration {step+1}/{num_iterations} ===")

        # Prune this iteration
        # WHY global_unstructured: Prune across all layers (balanced sparsity)
        parameters_to_prune = [
            (module, "weight")
            for module in model.modules()
            if isinstance(module, (nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d))
        ]

        prune.global_unstructured(
            parameters_to_prune,
            pruning_method=prune.L1Unstructured,
            amount=amount_per_iteration
        )

        # Evaluate current accuracy
        acc_before_finetune = evaluate(model)
        print(f"Accuracy after pruning: {acc_before_finetune:.2f}%")

        # Fine-tune to recover accuracy
        # WHY: Allow remaining weights to compensate for removed weights
        fine_tune(model, epochs=finetune_epochs, lr=1e-4)

        acc_after_finetune = evaluate(model)
        print(f"Accuracy after fine-tuning: {acc_after_finetune:.2f}%")

    # Make pruning permanent (remove masks)
    for module, param_name in parameters_to_prune:
        prune.remove(module, param_name)

    return model

# Example usage
model = resnet18(pretrained=True)
original_acc = evaluate(model)  # 69.8%

# One-shot pruning (worse quality)
model_oneshot = copy.deepcopy(model)
prune_global_unstructured(model_oneshot, amount=0.5)  # Prune 50% immediately
oneshot_acc = evaluate(model_oneshot)  # 59.7% (10.1pp drop!)

# Iterative pruning (better quality)
model_iterative = copy.deepcopy(model)
model_iterative = iterative_pruning(
    model_iterative,
    target_ratio=0.5,  # 50% pruning
    num_iterations=5,  # Gradual over 5 steps
    finetune_epochs=2  # Fine-tune after each step
)
iterative_acc = evaluate(model_iterative)  # 67.5% (2.3pp drop, much better!)

# Quality comparison:
# - One-shot: 10.1pp drop (unacceptable)
# - Iterative: 2.3pp drop (acceptable)
```

### Structured Layer Pruning (Transformers)

**Problem:** Transformers sensitive to unstructured pruning (destroys attention patterns).

**Solution:** Drop entire layers (structured pruning for transformers).

```python
def drop_transformer_layers(model, num_layers_to_drop=6):
    """
    Drop transformer layers (structured pruning for transformers).

    WHY drop layers: Transformers learn hierarchical features, later layers refine
    WHY not unstructured: Attention patterns are dense, pruning destroys them

    Example: BERT-base (12 layers) → BERT-small (6 layers)
    - Size: 440MB → 220MB (2× reduction)
    - Speed: 2× faster (half the layers)
    - Accuracy: 95% → 92% (3pp drop with fine-tuning)

    Args:
        model: Transformer model (BERT, GPT, T5)
        num_layers_to_drop: Number of layers to remove

    Returns:
        Smaller transformer model
    """
    # Identify which layers to drop
    # WHY drop middle layers: Keep early (low-level features) and late (task-specific)
    # Alternative: Drop early or late layers depending on task
    total_layers = len(model.encoder.layer)  # BERT example
    layers_to_keep = total_layers - num_layers_to_drop

    # Drop middle layers (preserve early and late layers)
    start_idx = num_layers_to_drop // 2
    end_idx = start_idx + layers_to_keep

    new_layers = model.encoder.layer[start_idx:end_idx]
    model.encoder.layer = nn.ModuleList(new_layers)

    # Update config
    model.config.num_hidden_layers = layers_to_keep

    print(f"Dropped {num_layers_to_drop} layers ({total_layers} → {layers_to_keep})")

    return model

# Example: Compress BERT-base
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
print(f"Original: {model.config.num_hidden_layers} layers, {get_model_size(model):.0f}MB")
# Original: 12 layers, 440MB

# Drop 6 layers (50% reduction)
model_compressed = drop_transformer_layers(model, num_layers_to_drop=6)
print(f"Compressed: {model_compressed.config.num_hidden_layers} layers, {get_model_size(model_compressed):.0f}MB")
# Compressed: 6 layers, 220MB

# Accuracy before fine-tuning
original_acc = evaluate(model)  # 95.2%
compressed_acc = evaluate(model_compressed)  # 88.5% (6.7pp drop)

## Part 2: Knowledge Distillation

### Progressive Distillation (Quality Preservation)

**Problem:** Single-stage aggressive distillation fails (77× compression → unusable quality).

**Solution:** Progressive distillation in multiple stages (2-4× per stage).

```python
def progressive_distillation(
    teacher,
    num_stages=2,
    compression_per_stage=2.5,
    distill_epochs=10,
    finetune_epochs=3
):
    """
    Progressive knowledge distillation (quality preservation for aggressive compression).

    WHY progressive: Large capacity gap (teacher → tiny student) loses too much knowledge
    WHY multi-stage: Smooth transition preserves quality (teacher → intermediate → final)

    Example: 6× compression
    - Single-stage: 774M → 130M (6× in one step) → 15pp accuracy drop (bad)
    - Progressive: 774M → 310M → 130M (2.5× per stage) → 5pp accuracy drop (better)

        teacher: Large pre-trained model (e.g., BERT-large, GPT-2 Large)
        num_stages: Number of distillation stages (2-3 typical)
        compression_per_stage: Compression ratio per stage (2-4× safe)
        distill_epochs: Distillation training epochs per stage

### Capacity Matching Guidelines

**Problem:** Student too small → can't learn teacher knowledge. Student too large → inefficient.

**Solution:** Match student capacity to compression target and quality tolerance.

```python
def calculate_optimal_student_capacity(
    teacher_params,
    target_compression,
    quality_tolerance,
    architecture_type
):
    """
    Calculate optimal student model capacity.

    Compression guidelines:
    - 2-4× compression: Minimal quality loss (1-3pp)
    - 4-8× compression: Acceptable quality loss (3-7pp) with fine-tuning
    - 8-15× compression: Significant quality loss (7-15pp), risky
    - >15× compression: Usually fails, student lacks capacity

    Progressive distillation for >4× compression:
    - Stage 1: Teacher → Student 1 (2-4× compression)

## Part 3: Low-Rank Decomposition

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Linear Layers

**Problem:** Large weight matrices (e.g., 4096×4096 in transformers) consume memory.

**Solution:** Decompose into two smaller matrices (low-rank factorization).

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def decompose_linear_layer_svd(layer, rank_ratio=0.5):
    """
    Decompose linear layer using SVD (low-rank approximation).

    WHY: Large matrix W (m×n) → two smaller matrices U (m×r) and V (r×n)
    WHY works: Weight matrices often have low effective rank (redundancy)

    Example: Linear(4096, 4096) with 50% rank
    - Original: 16.8M parameters (4096×4096)
    - Decomposed: 4.1M parameters (4096×2048 + 2048×4096) - 4× reduction!

    Args:
        layer: nn.Linear layer to decompose
        rank_ratio: Fraction of original rank to keep (0.5 = keep 50%)

    Returns:
        Sequential module with two linear layers (equivalent to original)
    """
    # Get weight matrix
    W = layer.weight.data  # Shape: (out_features, in_features)
    bias = layer.bias.data if layer.bias is not None else None

    # Perform SVD: W = U @ S @ V^T
    # WHY SVD: Optimal low-rank approximation (minimizes reconstruction error)
    U, S, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)

    # Determine rank to keep
    original_rank = min(W.shape)
    target_rank = int(original_rank * rank_ratio)

    print(f"Original rank: {original_rank}, Target rank: {target_rank}")

    # Truncate to target rank
    # WHY keep largest singular values: They capture most of the information
    U_k = U[:, :target_rank]  # Shape: (out_features, target_rank)
    S_k = S[:target_rank]  # Shape: (target_rank,)
    Vt_k = Vt[:target_rank, :]  # Shape: (target_rank, in_features)

    # Create two linear layers: W ≈ U_k @ diag(S_k) @ Vt_k
    # Layer 1: Linear(in_features, target_rank) with weights Vt_k
    # Layer 2: Linear(target_rank, out_features) with weights U_k @ diag(S_k)
    layer1 = nn.Linear(W.shape[1], target_rank, bias=False)
    layer1.weight.data = Vt_k

    layer2 = nn.Linear(target_rank, W.shape[0], bias=(bias is not None))
    layer2.weight.data = U_k * S_k.unsqueeze(0)  # Incorporate S into second layer

    if bias is not None:
        layer2.bias.data = bias

    # Return sequential module (equivalent to original layer)
    return nn.Sequential(layer1, layer2)

# Example: Decompose large transformer feedforward layer
original_layer = nn.Linear(4096, 4096)
print(f"Original params: {count_parameters(original_layer):,}")  # 16,781,312

# Decompose with 50% rank retention
decomposed_layer = decompose_linear_layer_svd(original_layer, rank_ratio=0.5)
print(f"Decomposed params: {count_parameters(decomposed_layer):,}")  # 4,194,304 (4× reduction!)

# Verify reconstruction quality
x = torch.randn(1, 128, 4096)  # Example input
y_original = original_layer(x)
y_decomposed = decomposed_layer(x)

reconstruction_error = torch.norm(y_original - y_decomposed) / torch.norm(y_original)
print(f"Reconstruction error: {reconstruction_error.item():.4f}")  # Small error (good approximation)
```

### Apply SVD to Entire Model

```python
def decompose_model_svd(model, rank_ratio=0.5, layer_threshold=1024):
    """
    Apply SVD decomposition to all large linear layers in model.

    WHY selective: Only decompose large layers (small layers don't benefit)

## Part 4: Combined Compression Pipelines

### Quantization + Pruning + Distillation

**Problem:** Single technique insufficient for aggressive compression (e.g., 20× for mobile).

**Solution:** Combine multiple techniques (multiplicative compression).

```python

    teacher_model,
    target_compression=20,
    deployment_target="mobile"
):
    """

    - Pruning: 2× reduction (50% structured pruning)
    - Distillation: 2.5× reduction (progressive distillation)
    - Total: 4 × 2 × 2.5 = 20× reduction!

    Pipeline order:
    1. Knowledge distillation (preserve quality first)
    2. Structured pruning (remove redundancy)
    3. Quantization (reduce precision last)

    WHY this order:
    - Distillation first: Creates smaller model with quality preservation
    - Pruning second: Removes redundancy from distilled model
    - Quantization last: Works well on already-compressed model

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| "Pruning works for all architectures" | Destroys transformer attention | Use distillation for transformers |
| "More compression is always better" | 77× compression produces gibberish | Progressive distillation for >4× |
| "Unstructured pruning speeds up inference" | No speedup on standard hardware | Use structured pruning (channel/layer) |
| "Quantize and deploy immediately" | 5pp accuracy drop without recovery | QAT + fine-tuning for quality preservation |
| "Single technique is enough" | Can't reach aggressive targets (20×) | Combine: quantization + pruning + distillation |
| "Skip fine-tuning to save time" | Preventable accuracy loss | Always include recovery step |

---

## Success Criteria

You've correctly compressed a model when:

✅ Selected appropriate technique for architecture (distillation for transformers, pruning for CNNs)
✅ Matched student capacity to compression target (2-4× per stage, progressive for >4×)
✅ Used structured pruning for standard hardware (actual speedup)
✅ Applied iterative/progressive compression (quality preservation)
✅ Included accuracy recovery (QAT, fine-tuning, calibration)
✅ Achieved target compression with acceptable quality loss (<5pp for most tasks)
✅ Verified deployment constraints (size, latency, accuracy) are met
