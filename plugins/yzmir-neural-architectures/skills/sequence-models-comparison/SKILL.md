# Sequence Models Comparison: Choosing the Right Architecture for Sequential Data

<CRITICAL_CONTEXT>
Sequence modeling has evolved rapidly:
- 2014-2017: LSTM/GRU dominated
- 2017+: Transformers revolutionized the field
- 2018+: TCN emerged as efficient alternative
- 2021+: Sparse Transformers for very long sequences
- 2022+: State Space Models (S4) for extreme lengths

Don't default to LSTM (outdated) or blindly use Transformers (not always appropriate).
Match architecture to your sequence characteristics.
</CRITICAL_CONTEXT>

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- ✅ Selecting model for sequential/temporal data
- ✅ Comparing RNN vs LSTM vs Transformer
- ✅ Deciding on sequence architecture for time series, text, audio
- ✅ Understanding modern alternatives to LSTM
- ✅ Optimizing for sequence length, speed, or accuracy

DO NOT use for:
- ❌ Vision tasks (use cnn-families-and-selection)
- ❌ Graph-structured data (use graph-neural-networks-basics)
- ❌ LLM-specific questions (use llm-specialist pack)

**When in doubt:** If data is sequential/temporal → this skill.

## Selection Framework

### Step 1: Identify Key Characteristics

**Before recommending, ask:**

| Characteristic | Question | Impact |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| **Sequence Length** | Typical length? | Short (< 100) → LSTM/CNN, Medium (100-1k) → Transformer, Long (> 1k) → Sparse Transformer/S4 |
| **Data Type** | Language, time series, audio? | Language → Transformer, Time series → TCN/Transformer, Audio → Specialized |
| **Data Volume** | Training examples? | Small (< 10k) → LSTM/TCN, Large (> 100k) → Transformer |
| **Latency** | Real-time needed? | Yes → TCN/LSTM, No → Transformer |
| **Deployment** | Cloud/edge/mobile? | Edge → TCN/LSTM, Cloud → Any |

### Step 2: Apply Decision Tree

```
START: What's your primary constraint?

┌─ SEQUENCE LENGTH
│  ├─ Short (< 100 steps)
│  │  ├─ Language → BiLSTM or small Transformer

│  │
│  ├─ Medium (100-1000 steps)
│  │  ├─ Language → Transformer (BERT-style)
│  │  └─ Time series → Transformer or TCN
│  │
│  ├─ Long (1000-10000 steps)
│  │  ├─ Sparse Transformer (Longformer, BigBird)
│  │  └─ Hierarchical models
│  │
│  └─ Very Long (> 10000 steps)
│     └─ State Space Models (S4)
│
├─ DATA TYPE
│  ├─ Natural Language
│  │  ├─ < 50k data → BiLSTM or DistilBERT
│  │  └─ > 50k data → Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa)
│  │
│  ├─ Time Series
│  │  ├─ Fast training → TCN
│  │  ├─ Long sequences → Transformer
│  │  └─ Multivariate → Transformer with cross-series attention
│  │
│  └─ Audio
│     ├─ Waveform → WaveNet (TCN-based)
│     └─ Spectrograms → CNN + Transformer
│
└─ COMPUTATIONAL CONSTRAINT
   ├─ Edge device → TCN or small LSTM
   ├─ Real-time latency → TCN (parallel inference)
   └─ Cloud, no constraint → Transformer
```

## Architecture Catalog

### 1. RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) - Legacy Foundation

**Architecture:** Basic recurrent cell with hidden state

**Status:** **OUTDATED** - don't use for new projects

**Why it existed:**
- First neural approach to sequences
- Hidden state captures temporal information
- Theoretically can model any sequence

**Why it failed:**
- Vanishing gradient (can't learn long dependencies)
- Very slow training (sequential processing)
- Replaced by LSTM in 2014

**When to mention:**
- Historical context only
- Teaching purposes
- Never recommend for production

**Key Insight:** Proved neural nets could handle sequences, but impractical due to vanishing gradients

---

### 2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - Legacy Standard

**Architecture:** Gated recurrent cell (forget, input, output gates)

**Complexity:** O(n) memory, sequential processing

**Strengths:**
- Solves vanishing gradient (gates maintain long-term info)
- Works well for short-medium sequences (< 500 steps)
- Small datasets (< 10k examples)
- Low memory footprint

**Weaknesses:**
- Sequential processing (slow training, can't parallelize)
- Still struggles with very long sequences (> 1000 steps)
- Slow inference (especially bidirectional)
- Superseded by Transformers for most language tasks

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Small datasets (< 10k examples)
- ✅ Short sequences (< 100 steps)
- ✅ Edge deployment (low memory)
- ✅ Baseline comparison

**When NOT to Use:**
- ❌ Large datasets (Transformer better)
- ❌ Long sequences (> 500 steps)
- ❌ Modern NLP (Transformer standard)
- ❌ Fast training needed (TCN better)

**Code Example:**
```python
class SeqLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size,
                           num_layers=2,
                           batch_first=True,
                           bidirectional=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch, seq_len, features)
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        # Use last timestep
        out = self.fc(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
        return out
```

**Status:** Legacy but still useful for specific cases (small data, edge deployment)

---

### 3. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) - Simplified LSTM

**Architecture:** Simplified gating (2 gates instead of 3)

**Advantages over LSTM:**
- Fewer parameters (faster training)
- Similar performance in many tasks
- Lower memory

**Disadvantages:**
- Still sequential (same as LSTM)
- No major advantage over LSTM in practice
- Also superseded by Transformers

**When to Use:**
- Same as LSTM, but prefer LSTM for slightly better performance
- Use if computational savings matter

**Status:** Rarely recommended - if using recurrent, prefer LSTM or move to Transformer/TCN

---

### 4. Transformer - Modern Standard

**Architecture:** Self-attention mechanism, parallel processing

**Complexity:**
- Memory: O(n²) for sequence length n
- Compute: O(n²d) where d is embedding dimension

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Parallel processing (fast training)
- ✅ Captures long-range dependencies (better than LSTM)
- ✅ State-of-the-art for language (BERT, GPT)
- ✅ Pre-trained models available
- ✅ Scales with data (more data = better performance)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Quadratic memory (struggles with sequences > 1000)
- ❌ Needs more data than LSTM (> 10k examples)
- ❌ Slower inference than TCN
- ❌ Harder to interpret than RNN

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Natural language** (current standard)
- ✅ Medium sequences (100-1000 tokens)
- ✅ Large datasets (> 50k examples)
- ✅ Pre-training available (BERT, GPT)
- ✅ Accuracy priority

**When NOT to Use:**
- ❌ Short sequences (< 50 tokens) - LSTM/CNN competitive, simpler
- ❌ Very long sequences (> 2000) - quadratic memory explodes
- ❌ Small datasets (< 10k) - will overfit
- ❌ Edge deployment - large model size

**Memory Analysis:**
```python
# Standard Transformer attention

# For sequence length n=1000, batch_size=32, embedding_dim=512:
attention_weights = softmax(Q @ K^T / sqrt(d))  # Shape: (32, 1000, 1000)
# Memory: 32 * 1000 * 1000 * 4 bytes = 128 MB just for attention!

# For n=5000:
# Memory: 32 * 5000 * 5000 * 4 bytes = 3.2 GB per batch!
# → Impossible on most GPUs
```

**Code Example:**
```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

# Pre-trained BERT for text classification
class TransformerClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(768, num_classes)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.bert(input_ids=input_ids,
                           attention_mask=attention_mask)
        # Use [CLS] token representation
        pooled = outputs.pooler_output
        return self.classifier(pooled)

# Fine-tuning
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = TransformerClassifier(num_classes=2)
```

**Status:** **Current standard for NLP**, competitive for time series with large data

### 5. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) - Underrated Alternative

**Architecture:** 1D convolutions with dilated causal convolutions

**Complexity:** O(n) memory, fully parallel processing

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Parallel training** (much faster than LSTM)
- ✅ **Parallel inference** (faster than LSTM/Transformer)
- ✅ Linear memory (no quadratic blow-up)
- ✅ Large receptive field (dilation)
- ✅ Works well for time series
- ✅ Simple architecture

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Less popular (fewer pre-trained models)
- ❌ Not standard for language (Transformer dominates)
- ❌ Fixed receptive field (vs adaptive attention)

**When to Use:**
- ✅ **Time series forecasting** (often BETTER than LSTM)
- ✅ **Fast training needed** (2-3x faster than LSTM)
- ✅ **Fast inference** (real-time applications)
- ✅ Long sequences (linear memory)
- ✅ Audio processing (WaveNet is TCN-based)

**When NOT to Use:**
- ❌ Natural language with pre-training available (use Transformer)
- ❌ Need very large receptive field (Transformer better)

**Performance Comparison:**
```
Time series forecasting (1000-step sequences):

Training speed:
- LSTM: 100% (baseline, sequential)
- TCN: 35% (2.8x faster, parallel)
- Transformer: 45% (2.2x faster)

Inference speed:
- LSTM: 100% (sequential)
- TCN: 20% (5x faster, parallel)
- Transformer: 60% (1.7x faster)

Accuracy (similar across all three):
- LSTM: Baseline
- TCN: Equal or slightly better
- Transformer: Equal or slightly better (needs more data)

Conclusion: TCN wins on speed, matches accuracy
```

**Code Example:**
```python
class TCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, num_channels, kernel_size=3):
        super().__init__()

        layers = []
        num_levels = len(num_channels)

        for i in range(num_levels):
            dilation_size = 2 ** i
            in_channels = input_channels if i == 0 else num_channels[i-1]
            out_channels = num_channels[i]

            # Causal dilated convolution
            layers.append(
                nn.Conv1d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size,
                         padding=(kernel_size-1) * dilation_size,
                         dilation=dilation_size)
            )
            layers.append(nn.ReLU())
            layers.append(nn.Dropout(0.2))

        self.network = nn.Sequential(*layers)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.network(x)

# Usage for time series
# Input: (batch, channels, sequence_length)
model = TCN(input_channels=1, num_channels=[64, 128, 256])
```

**Key Insight:** Dilated convolutions create exponentially large receptive field (2^k) while maintaining linear memory

**Status:** **Excellent for time series**, underrated, should be considered before LSTM

**Fix:** Consider Transformer for language, TCN for time series, LSTM for small data/edge only

---

### Pitfall 2: Using Standard Transformer for Very Long Sequences
**Symptom:** Running out of memory on sequences > 1000 tokens

**Why it's wrong:** O(n²) memory explodes

---

### Pitfall 3: Not Trying TCN for Time Series
**Symptom:** Struggling with slow LSTM training

**Why it's wrong:** TCN is 2-3x faster, often more accurate

---

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Sequence Length Constraints
**Symptom:** Choosing architecture without considering typical sequence length

**Why it's wrong:** Architecture effectiveness varies dramatically with length

**Fix:** Match architecture to sequence length (short → LSTM/CNN, long → Sparse Transformer)

☐ Training speed critical? (yes / no)

Based on answers:
→ Language + large data → Transformer
→ Language + small data → BiLSTM or DistilBERT
→ Time series + speed → TCN
→ Time series + accuracy + large data → Transformer
→ Very long sequences → Sparse Transformer or S4
→ Edge deployment → TCN or LSTM
→ Real-time latency → TCN
```
