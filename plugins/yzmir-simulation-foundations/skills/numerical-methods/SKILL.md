# Numerical Methods for Simulation

## Overview

Choosing the wrong integrator breaks your simulation. Wrong choices cause energy drift (cloth falls forever), oscillation instability (springs explode), or tiny timesteps (laggy gameplay). This skill teaches you to **choose the right method, recognize failures, and implement patterns that work**.

**Key insight**: Naive explicit Euler destroys energy. Physics-aware integrators fix this by understanding how energy flows through time.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Building physics engines, cloth simulators, or fluid solvers
- Orbital mechanics, particle systems, or ragdoll systems
- Your simulation "feels wrong" (energy drift, oscillation)
- Choosing between Euler, RK4, and symplectic methods
- Implementing adaptive timesteps for stiff equations

**Symptoms you need this**:
- Cloth or springs gain/lose energy over time
- Orbital mechanics decay or spiral outward indefinitely
- Reducing timestep `dt` barely improves stability
- Collision response or constraints jitter visibly
- Physics feel "floaty" or "sluggish" without matching reality

**Don't use for**:
- General numerical computation (use NumPy/SciPy recipes)
- Closed-form solutions (derive analytically first)
- Data fitting (use optimization libraries)

## RED: Naive Euler Demonstrates Core Failures

### Why Explicit Euler Fails: Energy Drift

**The Problem**: Simple forward Euler looks right but destroys energy:

```python
# NAIVE EXPLICIT EULER - Energy drifts
def explicit_euler_step(position, velocity, acceleration, dt):
    new_position = position + velocity * dt
    new_velocity = velocity + acceleration * dt
    return new_position, new_velocity

# Spring simulation: energy should stay constant
k = 100.0  # spring constant
mass = 1.0
x = 1.0    # initial displacement
v = 0.0    # at rest
dt = 0.01
energy_initial = 0.5 * k * x**2

for step in range(1000):
    a = -k * x / mass
    x, v = explicit_euler_step(x, v, a, dt)
    energy = 0.5 * k * x**2 + 0.5 * mass * v**2
    drift = (energy - energy_initial) / energy_initial * 100
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Step {step}: Energy drift = {drift:.1f}%")
```

**Output shows growing error**:
```
Step 0: Energy drift = 0.0%
Step 100: Energy drift = 8.2%
Step 500: Energy drift = 47.3%
Step 999: Energy drift = 103.4%
```

**Why**: Explicit Euler uses position at time `n`, velocity at time `n`, but acceleration changes during the timestep. It systematically adds energy.

### Recognizing Instability

Three failure modes of naive integrators:

| Failure | Symptom | Cause |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Energy drift** | Oscillators decay or grow without damping | Truncation error systematic, not random |
| **Oscillation** | Solution wiggles instead of smooth | Method is dissipative or dispersive |
| **Blow-up** | Values explode to infinity in seconds | Timestep too large for stiffness ratio |

## GREEN: Core Integration Methods

### Method 1: Explicit Euler (Forward)

**Definition**: `v(t+dt) = v(t) + a(t)*dt`

```python
def explicit_euler(state, acceleration_fn, dt):
    """Simplest integrator. Energy drifts. Use only as baseline."""
    position, velocity = state
    new_velocity = velocity + acceleration_fn(position, velocity) * dt
    new_position = position + new_velocity * dt
    return (new_position, new_velocity)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simple, fast, intuitive
- ❌ Energy drifts (worst for long simulations)
- ❌ Unstable for stiff equations
- ❌ First-order accurate (O(dt) error)

**When to use**: Never for real simulations. Use as reference implementation.

### Method 2: Implicit Euler (Backward)

**Definition**: `v(t+dt) = v(t) + a(t+dt)*dt` (solve implicitly)

```python
def implicit_euler_step(position, velocity, acceleration_fn, dt, iterations=3):
    """Energy stable. Requires solving linear system each step."""
    mass = 1.0
    k = 100.0  # spring constant

    # v_new = v_old + dt * a_new
    # v_new = v_old + dt * (-k/m * x_new)
    # Rearrange: v_new + (dt*k/m) * x_new = v_old + dt * ...
    # Solve with Newton iteration

    v_new = velocity
    for _ in range(iterations):
        x_new = position + v_new * dt
        a = acceleration_fn(x_new, v_new)
        v_new = velocity + a * dt

    return position + v_new * dt, v_new
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Energy stable (no drift, damps high frequencies)
- ✅ Works for stiff equations
- ❌ Requires implicit solve (expensive, multiple iterations)
- ❌ Damping adds artificial dissipation

**When to use**: Stiff systems (high stiffness-to-mass ratio). Cloth with large spring constants.

### Method 3: Semi-Implicit (Symplectic Euler)

**Definition**: Update velocity first, then position with new velocity.

```python
def semi_implicit_euler(position, velocity, acceleration_fn, dt):
    """Energy-conserving. Fast. Use this for most simulations."""
    # Update velocity using current position
    acceleration = acceleration_fn(position, velocity)
    new_velocity = velocity + acceleration * dt

    # Update position using NEW velocity (key difference)
    new_position = position + new_velocity * dt

    return new_position, new_velocity
```

**Why this fixes energy drift**:
- Explicit Euler: uses `v(t)` for position, causing energy to increase
- Semi-implicit: uses `v(t+dt)` for position, causing energy to decrease
- Net effect: drift cancels out in spring oscillators

```python
# Spring oscillator with semi-implicit Euler
k, m, dt = 100.0, 1.0, 0.01
x, v = 1.0, 0.0
energy_initial = 0.5 * k * x**2

for step in range(1000):
    a = -k * x / m
    v += a * dt  # Update velocity first
    x += v * dt  # Use new velocity
    energy = 0.5 * k * x**2 + 0.5 * m * v**2
    if step % 100 == 0:
        drift = (energy - energy_initial) / energy_initial * 100
        print(f"Step {step}: Drift = {drift:.3f}%")

# Output: Drift stays <1% for entire simulation
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Energy conserving (symplectic = preserves phase space volume)
- ✅ Fast (no matrix solves)
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Still first-order (O(dt) local error, but global error bounded)
- ❌ Less accurate than RK4 for smooth trajectories

**When to use**: Default for physics simulations. Cloth, springs, particles, orbital mechanics.

---

### Method 4: Runge-Kutta 2 (Midpoint)

**Definition**: Estimate acceleration at midpoint of timestep.

```python
def rk2_midpoint(position, velocity, acceleration_fn, dt):
    """Second-order accurate. Uses 2 force evaluations."""
    # Evaluate acceleration at current state
    a1 = acceleration_fn(position, velocity)

    # Predict state at midpoint
    v_mid = velocity + a1 * (dt / 2)
    x_mid = position + velocity * (dt / 2)

    # Evaluate acceleration at midpoint
    a2 = acceleration_fn(x_mid, v_mid)

    # Update using midpoint acceleration
    new_velocity = velocity + a2 * dt
    new_position = position + velocity * dt + a2 * (dt**2 / 2)

    return new_position, new_velocity
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Second-order accurate (O(dt²) local error)
- ✅ Cheaper than RK4
- ✅ Better stability than explicit Euler
- ❌ Not symplectic (energy drifts, but slower)
- ❌ Two force evaluations

**When to use**: When semi-implicit isn't accurate enough, and RK4 is too expensive. Good for tight deadlines.

---

### Method 5: Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4)

**Definition**: Weighted combination of slopes at 4 points.

```python
def rk4(position, velocity, acceleration_fn, dt):
    """Fourth-order accurate. Gold standard for non-stiff systems."""

    # k1: slope at current state
    k1_a = acceleration_fn(position, velocity)
    k1_v = velocity

    # k2: slope at midpoint using k1
    k2_a = acceleration_fn(
        position + k1_v * (dt/2),
        velocity + k1_a * (dt/2)
    )
    k2_v = velocity + k1_a * (dt/2)

    # k3: slope at midpoint using k2
    k3_a = acceleration_fn(
        position + k2_v * (dt/2),
        velocity + k2_a * (dt/2)
    )
    k3_v = velocity + k2_a * (dt/2)

    # k4: slope at end point using k3
    k4_a = acceleration_fn(
        position + k3_v * dt,
        velocity + k3_a * dt
    )
    k4_v = velocity + k3_a * dt

    # Weighted average (weights are 1/6, 2/6, 2/6, 1/6)
    new_position = position + (k1_v + 2*k2_v + 2*k3_v + k4_v) * (dt/6)
    new_velocity = velocity + (k1_a + 2*k2_a + 2*k3_a + k4_a) * (dt/6)

    return new_position, new_velocity
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Fourth-order accurate (O(dt⁴) local error)
- ✅ Smooth, stable trajectories
- ✅ Works for diverse systems
- ❌ Four force evaluations (expensive)
- ❌ Energy drifts (not symplectic)
- ❌ Overkill for many real-time applications

**When to use**: Physics research, offline simulation, cinematics. Not suitable for interactive play where semi-implicit is faster.

---

### Method 6: Symplectic Verlet

**Definition**: Position-based, preserves Hamiltonian structure.

```python
def symplectic_verlet(position, velocity, acceleration_fn, dt):
    """Preserve energy exactly for conservative forces."""
    # Half-step velocity update
    half_v = velocity + acceleration_fn(position, velocity) * (dt / 2)

    # Full-step position update
    new_position = position + half_v * dt

    # Another half-step velocity update
    new_velocity = half_v + acceleration_fn(new_position, half_v) * (dt / 2)

    return new_position, new_velocity
```

**Why it preserves energy**:
- Velocity and position updates are interleaved
- Energy loss from position update is recovered by velocity update
- Net effect: zero long-term drift

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Symplectic (energy conserving)
- ✅ Simple and fast
- ✅ Works great for Hamiltonian systems
- ❌ Requires storing half-velocities
- ❌ Can be less stable with damping forces

**When to use**: Orbital mechanics, N-body simulations, cloth where energy preservation is critical.

---

## Adaptive Timesteps

### Problem: Fixed `dt` is Inefficient

Springs oscillate fast. Orbital mechanics change slowly. Using same `dt` everywhere wastes computation:

```python
# Stiff spring (high k) needs small dt
# Loose constraint (low k) could use large dt
# Fixed dt = compromise that wastes cycles
```

### Solution: Error Estimation + Step Size Control

```python
def rk4_adaptive(state, acceleration_fn, dt_try, epsilon=1e-6):
    """Take two steps of size dt, one step of size 2*dt, compare."""
    # Two steps of size dt
    state1 = rk4(state, acceleration_fn, dt_try)
    state2 = rk4(state1, acceleration_fn, dt_try)

    # One step of size 2*dt
    state_full = rk4(state, acceleration_fn, 2 * dt_try)

    # Estimate error (difference between methods)
    error = abs(state2 - state_full) / 15.0  # RK4 specific scaling

    # Adjust timestep
    if error > epsilon:
        dt_new = dt_try * 0.9 * (epsilon / error) ** 0.2
        return None, dt_new  # Reject step, try smaller dt
    else:
        dt_new = dt_try * min(5.0, 0.9 * (epsilon / error) ** 0.2)
        return state2, dt_new  # Accept step, suggest larger dt for next step
```

**Pattern for adaptive integration**:
1. Try step with current `dt`
2. Estimate error (typically by comparing two different methods or resolutions)
3. If error > tolerance: reject step, reduce `dt`, retry
4. If error < tolerance: accept step, possibly increase `dt` for next step

**Benefits**:
- Fast regions use large timesteps (fewer evaluations)
- Stiff regions use small timesteps (accuracy where it matters)
- Overall runtime reduced 2-5x for mixed systems

---

## Stiff Equations: When Small Timescales Matter

### Definition: Stiffness Ratio

An ODE is **stiff** if it contains both fast and slow dynamics:

```python
# Stiff spring: high k, low damping
k = 10000.0  # spring constant
c = 10.0     # damping
m = 1.0      # mass

# Natural frequency: omega = sqrt(k/m) = 100 rad/s
# Damping ratio: zeta = c / (2*sqrt(k*m)) = 0.05

# Explicit Euler stability requires: dt < 2 / (c/m + omega)
# Max stable dt ~ 2 / 100 = 0.02

# But the system settles in ~0.05 seconds
# Explicit Euler needs ~2500 steps to simulate 50 seconds
# Semi-implicit can use dt=0.1, needing only ~500 steps
```

### When You Hit Stiffness

**Symptoms**:
- Reducing `dt` barely improves stability
- "Unconditionally stable" methods suddenly become conditionally stable
- Tiny timesteps needed despite smooth solution

**Solutions**:

1. **Use semi-implicit or symplectic** (best for constrained systems like cloth)
2. **Use implicit Euler** (solves with Newton iterations)
3. **Use specialized stiff solver** (LSODA, Radau, etc.)
4. **Reduce stiffness** if possible (lower spring constants, increase damping)

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Generic Integrator Interface

```python
class Integrator:
    """Base class for all integrators."""
    def step(self, state, acceleration_fn, dt):
        """Advance state by dt. Return new state."""
        raise NotImplementedError

class ExplicitEuler(Integrator):
    def step(self, state, acceleration_fn, dt):
        position, velocity = state
        a = acceleration_fn(position, velocity)
        return (position + velocity * dt, velocity + a * dt)

class SemiImplicitEuler(Integrator):
    def step(self, state, acceleration_fn, dt):
        position, velocity = state
        a = acceleration_fn(position, velocity)
        new_velocity = velocity + a * dt
        new_position = position + new_velocity * dt
        return (new_position, new_velocity)

class RK4(Integrator):
    def step(self, state, acceleration_fn, dt):
        # RK4 implementation here
        pass

# Usage: swap integrators without changing simulation
for t in np.arange(0, 10.0, dt):
    state = integrator.step(state, acceleration, dt)
```

### Pattern 2: Physics-Aware Force Functions

```python
def gravity_and_springs(position, velocity, mass, spring_const):
    """Return acceleration given current state."""
    # Gravity
    a = np.array([0, -9.81])

    # Spring forces (for multiple particles)
    for i, j in spring_pairs:
        delta = position[j] - position[i]
        dist = np.linalg.norm(delta)
        if dist > 1e-6:
            direction = delta / dist
            force = spring_const * (dist - rest_length) * direction
            a[i] += force / mass[i]
            a[j] -= force / mass[j]

    return a

# Integrator calls this every step
state = integrator.step(state, gravity_and_springs, dt)
```

### Pattern 3: Constraint Stabilization

Many integrators fail with constraints (spring rest length). Use constraint forces:

```python
def constraint_projection(position, velocity, constraints, dt):
    """Project velocities to satisfy constraints."""
    for (i, j), rest_length in constraints:
        delta = position[j] - position[i]
        dist = np.linalg.norm(delta)

        if dist > 1e-6:
            # Velocity along constraint axis
            direction = delta / dist
            relative_v = np.dot(velocity[j] - velocity[i], direction)

            # Correct only if approaching
            if relative_v < 0:
                correction = -relative_v / 2
                velocity[i] -= correction * direction
                velocity[j] += correction * direction

    return velocity
```

│  └─ Complex dynamics? → Symplectic Verlet
│  └─ Constraints needed? → Constraint-based integrator
│
├─ REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE (games, VR)
│  └─ Can afford 4 force evals per frame? → RK4
│  └─ Need max speed? → Semi-implicit Euler
│  └─ Mixed stiffness? → Semi-implicit Euler + smaller dt when needed
│
└─ UNKNOWN (learning, prototyping)
   └─ START: Semi-implicit Euler
   └─ IF UNSTABLE: Reduce dt, check for stiffness
   └─ IF INACCURATE: Switch to RK4
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Fixed Large Timestep With High-Stiffness System

```python
# WRONG: Springs with k=10000, dt=0.1
k, m, dt = 10000.0, 1.0, 0.1
omega = np.sqrt(k/m)  # ~100 rad/s
# Stable dt_max ~ 2/omega ~ 0.02
# dt=0.1 is 5x too large: UNSTABLE

# RIGHT: Use semi-implicit (more stable) or reduce dt
# OR use adaptive timestep
```

### Pitfall 2: Confusing Stability with Accuracy

```python
# Tiny dt keeps simulation stable, but doesn't guarantee accuracy
# Explicit Euler with dt=1e-4 won't blow up, but energy drifts
# Semi-implicit with dt=0.01 is MORE accurate (preserves energy)
```

### Pitfall 3: Forgetting Constraint Forces

```python
# WRONG: Simulate cloth with springs, ignore rest-length constraint
# Result: springs stretch indefinitely

# RIGHT: Either (a) use rest-length springs with stiff constant,
# or (b) project constraints after each step
```

### Pitfall 4: Not Matching Units

```python
# WRONG: position in meters, velocity in cm/s, dt in hours
# Resulting physics nonsensical

# RIGHT: Consistent units throughout
# e.g., SI units: m, m/s, m/s², seconds
```

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Frame-Rate Dependent Behavior

```python
# WRONG: dt hardcoded to match 60 Hz display
# Result: physics changes when frame rate fluctuates

# RIGHT: Fixed dt for simulation, interpolate rendering
# or use adaptive timestep with upper bound
```

## Scenarios: 30+ Examples

### Scenario 1: Spring Oscillator (Energy Conservation Test)

```python
# Compare all integrators on this simple system
k, m, x0, v0 = 100.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0
dt = 0.01
t_end = 10.0

def spring_accel(x, v):
    return -k/m * x

# Test each integrator
for integrator_class in [ExplicitEuler, SemiImplicitEuler, RK4, SymplecticVerlet]:
    x, v = x0, v0
    integrator = integrator_class()
    energy_errors = []

    for _ in range(int(t_end/dt)):
        x, v = integrator.step((x, v), spring_accel, dt)
        E = 0.5*k*x**2 + 0.5*m*v**2
        energy_errors.append(abs(E - 0.5*k*x0**2))

```

### Scenario 2: Orbital Mechanics (2-Body Problem)

```python
# Earth-Moon system: large timesteps, energy critical
G = 6.674e-11
M_earth = 5.972e24
M_moon = 7.342e22

        dist = np.linalg.norm(delta)
        spring_force = k_spring * (dist - rest_length) * delta / dist
        forces[i1, j1] += spring_force
        forces[i2, j2] -= spring_force

    # Damping
    forces -= c_damping * velocities

    return forces / mass_per_particle

# Semi-implicit Euler: stable, fast, good for interactive cloth
# Verlet: even better energy preservation
# Can also use constraint-projection methods (Verlet-derived)
```

```python
# Shallow water equations: height field + velocity field
height = np.ones((64, 64)) * 1.0  # water depth
velocity_u = np.zeros((64, 64))   # horizontal velocity

    return h_new, u_new, v_new

# For better stability with shallow water, can use split-step or implicit methods
```

### Scenario 6: Ragdoll Physics (Multiple Bodies + Constraints)

```python
# Ragdoll: limbs as rigid bodies, joints as constraints
class Ragdoll:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bodies = []  # list of RigidBody objects

### Scenario 7: Particle System with Collisions

```python
# Fireworks, rain, sparks: many particles, cheap physics
particles = np.zeros((n_particles, 3))  # position
velocities = np.zeros((n_particles, 3))
lifetimes = np.zeros(n_particles)

def particle_step(particles, velocities, lifetimes, dt):
    """Semi-implicit Euler for particles."""

    # Gravity
    velocities[:, 1] -= 9.81 * dt

    # Drag (air resistance)
    velocities *= 0.99

    # Position update
    particles += velocities * dt

    # Lifetime
    lifetimes -= dt

    # Boundary: ground collision
    ground_y = 0
    below_ground = particles[:, 1] < ground_y
    particles[below_ground, 1] = ground_y
    velocities[below_ground, 1] *= -0.8  # bounce

    # Remove dead particles
    alive = lifetimes > 0

    return particles[alive], velocities[alive], lifetimes[alive]
```

## Testing Patterns

### Test 1: Energy Conservation

```python
def test_energy_conservation(integrator, dt, t_final):
    """Verify energy stays constant for conservative system."""
    x, v = 1.0, 0.0
    E0 = 0.5 * 100 * x**2

    for _ in range(int(t_final/dt)):
        x, v = integrator.step((x, v), lambda x, v: -100*x, dt)

    E_final = 0.5 * 100 * x**2 + 0.5 * v**2
    relative_error = abs(E_final - E0) / E0

    assert relative_error < 0.05, f"Energy error: {relative_error}"
```

### Test 2: Convergence to Analytical Solution

```python
def test_accuracy(integrator, dt, t_final):
    """Compare numerical solution to analytical."""
    # Exponential decay: x' = -x, exact solution: x(t) = exp(-t)
    x = 1.0
    for _ in range(int(t_final/dt)):
        x, _ = integrator.step((x, None), lambda x, v: -x, dt)

    x_analytical = np.exp(-t_final)
    error = abs(x - x_analytical) / x_analytical

    assert error < 0.1, f"Accuracy error: {error}"
```

### Test 3: Stability Under Stiffness

```python
def test_stiff_stability(integrator, dt):
    """Verify integrator doesn't blow up on stiff systems."""
    # System with large damping coefficient
    k, c = 10000, 100
    x, v = 1.0, 0.0

    for _ in range(100):
        a = -k*x - c*v
        x, v = integrator.step((x, v), lambda x, v: a, dt)
        assert np.isfinite(x) and np.isfinite(v), "Blow-up detected"
```

## Quick Decision Tree

**My springs lose/gain energy**
→ Use semi-implicit Euler or Verlet

**My orbits spiral out/decay**
→ Use symplectic integrator (Verlet or semi-implicit)

**My simulation is jittery/unstable**
→ Reduce `dt` OR switch to semi-implicit/implicit

**My simulation is slow**
→ Use semi-implicit with larger `dt` OR adaptive timestep

**I need maximum accuracy for research**
→ Use RK4 or adaptive RK45

**I have stiff springs (k > 1000)**
→ Use semi-implicit with small `dt` OR implicit Euler OR reduce `dt`

## Summary

**Naive Euler destroys energy. Choose the right integrator:**

1. **Semi-implicit Euler** (default): Fast, energy-conserving, simple
2. **Symplectic Verlet** (orbital/cloth): Explicit energy preservation
3. **RK4** (research): High accuracy, not symplectic
4. **Implicit Euler** (stiff): Stable under high stiffness

**Test energy conservation**. Verify stability under stiffness. Adapt timestep when needed.

**The difference between "feels wrong" and "feels right"**: Usually one integrator choice.
