# Using Simulation-Foundations (Meta-Skill Router)

**Your entry point to mathematical simulation foundations.** This skill routes you to the right combination of mathematical skills for your game simulation challenge.

## Purpose

This is a **meta-skill** that:
1. ✅ **Routes** you to the correct mathematical skills
2. ✅ **Combines** multiple skills for complex simulations
3. ✅ **Provides** workflows for common simulation types
4. ✅ **Explains** when to use theory vs empirical tuning

**You should use this skill:** When building any simulation system that needs mathematical rigor.

## Core Philosophy: Theory Enables Design

### The Central Idea

**Empirical Tuning**: Trial-and-error adjustment of magic numbers
- Slow iteration (run simulation, observe, tweak, repeat)
- Unpredictable behavior (systems drift to extremes)
- No guarantees (stability, convergence, performance)
- Difficult debugging (why did it break?)

**Mathematical Foundation**: Formulate systems using theory
- Fast iteration (predict behavior analytically)
- Predictable behavior (stability analysis)
- Guarantees (equilibrium, convergence, bounds)
- Systematic debugging (root cause analysis)

### When This Pack Applies

**✅ Use simulation-foundations when:**
- Building physics, AI, or economic simulation systems
- Need stability guarantees (ecosystems, economies)
- Performance matters (60 FPS real-time constraints)
- Multiplayer determinism required (lockstep networking)
- Long-term behavior unpredictable (100+ hour campaigns)

**❌ Don't use simulation-foundations when:**
- Simple systems with no continuous dynamics
- Pure authored content (no simulation)
- Empirical tuning sufficient (static balance tables)
- Math overhead not justified (tiny indie game)
