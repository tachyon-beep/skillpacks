## Development Workflow

### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Methodology

All skills MUST be tested before deployment using the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

#### RED Phase: Baseline Test WITHOUT Skill

**Goal:** Objectively measure what Claude misses without your skill.

**Process:**
1. Create realistic scenario where your skill should help
2. Test Claude (via subagent or fresh session) WITHOUT loading your skill
3. Document failures objectively:
   - What did Claude miss?
   - What did Claude get wrong?
   - What was inefficient or unclear?

**Example (threat-modeling skill):**
```
Scenario: Design auth API, need threat analysis

WITHOUT skill:
‚ùå Missed STRIDE methodology (used ad-hoc intuition)
‚ùå No attack trees (listed threats but no paths)
‚ùå No risk scoring (couldn't prioritize threats)
‚ùå No systematic coverage (missed info disclosure threats)
```

**Critical Rule:** Never skip baseline testing. If you can't identify concrete failures, the skill may not be needed.

---

#### GREEN Phase: Create Skill Addressing Failures

**Goal:** Write skill that addresses every documented baseline failure.

**Process:**
1. Review baseline failures from RED phase
2. Write skill that explicitly teaches missing patterns/methodologies
3. Include real-world examples (3+ concrete examples)
4. Add cross-references to complementary skills
5. Document "When to Use" section with clear triggers

**Skill Structure:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name-here
description: Use when [trigger] - covers [what it teaches]
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
[Core principle and key insight]

## When to Use
[Trigger situations, symptoms, anti-patterns]

## [Core Content Sections]
[Teach the methodology with examples]

## Cross-References
**Use WITH:** [related skills]

## Real-World Impact
[Proven effectiveness with concrete examples]
```

**Design Principles:**
- Teach patterns and methodology (not exhaustive lists)
- Use concrete examples (no placeholders like `YOUR_KEY_HERE`)
- Include decision trees and checklists
- Cross-reference bidirectionally (skill A ‚Üí skill B, skill B ‚Üí skill A)

---

#### REFACTOR Phase: Verification Test WITH Skill

**Goal:** Prove skill addresses all baseline failures.

**Process:**
1. Test Claude (via subagent) WITH your skill loaded
2. Apply to same scenario from RED phase
3. Verify every baseline failure is now resolved
4. Test under pressure:
   - Time constraints ("90-minute emergency patch")
   - Edge cases
   - Scope creep scenarios

**Example (threat-modeling skill):**
```
Scenario: Same auth API design

WITH skill:
‚úÖ Applied STRIDE systematically (all 6 categories)
‚úÖ Built attack trees with feasibility marking
‚úÖ Scored risks with Likelihood √ó Impact matrix
‚úÖ Found ALL threats (including info disclosure)
```

**If any baseline failures remain:** Return to GREEN phase, improve skill, re-test.

**Testing Tools:**
- Use `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` for rigorous testing
- Dispatch fresh subagent for each test (no context pollution)
- Test same scenario WITHOUT skill (RED), then WITH skill (REFACTOR)

---

### Git Commit Pattern

All commits follow a consistent pattern established in Phases 1-3.

**Skill Implementation Commits:**
```
Implement {faction}/{pack}/{skill-name} (Phase X, Skill Y/Z)

RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle complete:

RED Phase:
- Tested scenario [X] without skill
- Documented [N] baseline failures: [brief list]

GREEN Phase:
- Created skill addressing all failures
- Included [pattern/methodology Y]
- Added [N] real-world examples

REFACTOR Phase:
- Tested WITH skill - all failures resolved
- Tested under pressure - maintains discipline
- Skill is bulletproof

### Faction Organization

Skills are grouped by Altered TCG-inspired factions for thematic coherence.

**The Six Factions:**

1. **Ordis** (Protectors of Order): Security architecture, controls, governance, protection
2. **Muna** (Weavers of Harmony): Documentation, synthesis, cross-discipline patterns
3. **Axiom** (Creators of Marvels): Tooling, infrastructure, automation (future)
4. **Bravos** (Champions of Action): Practical tactics, debugging, reliability (future)
5. **Lyra** (Nomadic Artists): UX, creative design, human-centered (future)
6. **Yzmir** (Magicians of Mind): Theory, algorithms, cryptography (future)

**Current Implementation:**
- **Ordis:** `security-architect` (10 skills) - Complete
- **Muna:** `technical-writer` (8 skills) - Complete

**Naming Convention:**
```
{faction}/{pack-name}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
```

**Examples:**
- `ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling/SKILL.md`
- `muna/technical-writer/documentation-structure/SKILL.md`

**Cross-Faction References:**
Skills can and should reference skills from other factions:
- `ordis/security-architect/documenting-threats-and-controls` ‚Üí `muna/technical-writer/documentation-structure`
- `muna/technical-writer/security-aware-documentation` ‚Üí `ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling`

See [FACTIONS.md](FACTIONS.md) for complete faction organization guide.

## Testing Skills

### Testing Methodology

Use `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` for all skill testing.

**Workflow:**
1. **Dispatch subagent** - Fresh Claude instance with no context pollution
2. **RED phase test** - Test scenario WITHOUT skill, document failures
3. **GREEN phase** - Write skill addressing failures
4. **Dispatch new subagent** - Fresh instance for verification test
5. **REFACTOR phase test** - Test scenario WITH skill, verify all failures resolved

**Testing Under Pressure:**
- Time constraints: "You have 90 minutes to ship this emergency patch"
- Edge cases: Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios
- Scope creep: "Actually, we also need [additional requirement]"

**Success Criteria:**
- All baseline failures resolved
- Skill maintains discipline under pressure
- No rationalization or shortcuts taken
- Concrete, actionable guidance provided

---

## Critical Reminders

### The Iron Law
```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

### Required Skills to USE
Before creating new skills, you must use:
- `superpowers:using-superpowers` (mandatory first)
- `superpowers:writing-skills` (skill creation methodology)
- `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` (testing approach)

### Workflow Per Skill
```
RED (baseline test WITHOUT skill)
  ‚Üì
GREEN (write skill addressing failures)
  ‚Üì
REFACTOR (verify under pressure)
  ‚Üì
COMMIT (one skill at a time)
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Skipping RED phase** - Always test baseline first
2. **Batching commits** - One skill per commit
3. **Incomplete examples** - Use complete, runnable examples (not placeholders)
4. **Missing cross-references** - Link to complementary skills bidirectionally
5. **Testing with context pollution** - Always use fresh subagent for verification

---

## Design Principles

1. **Layered:** Core (universal) + Extensions (specialized contexts)
2. **Modular:** Load only what you need
3. **Cross-Referenced:** Bidirectional knowledge graph between skills
4. **TDD for Documentation:** Every skill tested before deployment
5. **Meta-Aware:** Teach patterns and methodology, not exhaustive lists

**Example:** `compliance-awareness-and-mapping` teaches "frameworks vary by jurisdiction" + discovery process, NOT hardcoded list of all frameworks.

---

## Origin Story

Designed alongside **Elspeth** (security-first LLM orchestration platform) but universal and reusable.

**Informed by:**
- Bell-LaPadula MLS enforcement in classified systems
- ADR-quality documentation practices
- TDD-based complexity reduction methodology
- High-security/regulated environment patterns (government, healthcare, finance)

**Applies to any project:** Web apps, mobile, embedded, data pipelines, infrastructure.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**After Phase 1:** ‚úÖ Foundation proven, can load meta-skills to route to core skills
**After Phase 2:** ‚úÖ Universal core skills usable across any project
**After Phase 3:** ‚úÖ Specialized extensions for high-security/regulated environments
**After Phase 4:** üìã Public-quality skill packs ready for community use

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 4: Public Release Polish (8-14 hours)**
- Wave 1: Repository polish (README restructure, CONTRIBUTING.md, governance files)
- Wave 2: Plugin packaging (plugin.json, marketplace submission)
- Wave 3: Tutorials (5 end-to-end scenarios across diverse domains)

See [docs/plans/2025-10-29-phase-4-public-release-implementation.md](docs/plans/2025-10-29-phase-4-public-release-implementation.md) for Phase 4 implementation plan.
