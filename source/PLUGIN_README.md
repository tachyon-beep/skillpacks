## Example Uses

**Threat Model a REST API in Minutes**
```
"I'm using ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling to analyze our
authentication API for security threats."

→ Claude applies STRIDE methodology, identifies spoofing/tampering/repudiation
  risks, maps attack trees, and scores severity
```

**Write Security-Compliant Documentation**
```
"I'm using muna/technical-writer/security-aware-documentation to create
API documentation with sanitized examples."

→ Claude generates examples with obviously-fake credentials, prevents
  accidental secret leaks, and follows security best practices
```

**Build Government Authorization Packages**
```
"I'm using ordis/security-architect/security-authorization-and-accreditation
to prepare ATO documentation for our classified system."

→ Claude guides you through RMF 7-step process, generates SSP/SAR/POA&M
  templates, ensures compliance with NIST standards
```

**Create Incident Response Plans**
```
"I'm using muna/technical-writer/incident-response-documentation to build
our runbooks."

→ Claude creates 5-phase response templates, time-critical procedures,
  escalation paths
```

**Design Secure Systems from Scratch**
```
"I'm using ordis/security-architect/secure-by-design-patterns for our
new microservices architecture."

→ Claude applies zero-trust principles, immutable infrastructure patterns,
  least-privilege design
```
