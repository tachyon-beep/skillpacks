# Security Architect & Technical Writer Skill Packs

**Status**: Design Complete, Ready for Phase 1 Implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Packs**: 2 (security-architect, technical-writer)
**Total Skills**: 16 (2 meta + 8 core + 6 extensions)

---

## What This Is

Universal skill packs for Claude Code providing:
- **security-architect**: Threat modeling, security controls, architecture review, secure patterns, classified systems, compliance, authorization
- **technical-writer**: Documentation structure, clarity, diagrams, testing, security-aware docs, incident response, governance, operational acceptance

**Key Innovation**: Layered architecture (universal core + specialized extensions) with bidirectional cross-references creating knowledge graph.

---

## Current Phase: Foundation (Phase 1)

**Phase 1 Skills Progress**:
1. âœ… `ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect` (meta-skill, routing) - **COMPLETE**
2. âœ… `ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling` (core technique) - **COMPLETE**
3. âœ… `muna/technical-writer/using-technical-writer` (meta-skill, routing) - **COMPLETE**
4. ðŸ”„ `muna/technical-writer/documentation-structure` (core reference) - **NEXT** (Final Skill!)

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 hours

---

## Quick Start for Claude

**When you arrive in new repo, read in this order:**

1. **This file** (README.md) - Status and quick start
2. **planning/GETTING_STARTED.md** - Implementation workflow and critical reminders
3. **planning/2025-10-28-security-architect-technical-writer-design.md** - Complete design (10,000 words, every skill detailed)

**Then start implementing:**
```
I'm using the writing-skills skill to create ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect.
```

---

## Critical Reminders

### The Iron Law
```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

### Required Skills to USE
- `superpowers:using-superpowers` (mandatory first)
- `superpowers:writing-skills` (skill creation methodology)
- `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` (testing approach)

### Workflow Per Skill
```
RED (baseline test WITHOUT skill)
  â†“
GREEN (write skill addressing failures)
  â†“
REFACTOR (close loopholes under pressure)
  â†“
COMMIT (one skill at a time)
```

**Faction Organization**: Skills are thematically grouped by Altered TCG-inspired factions. See FACTIONS.md for details.

## Repository Independence

This project is **orthogonal to Elspeth** (the project where it was designed). It has:
- âœ… Complete design documentation
- âœ… Implementation workflow
- âœ… Testing methodology
- âœ… Phase-by-phase plan
- âœ… Zero dependencies on Elspeth codebase

**Claude can work independently with ONLY contents of this repo.**

---

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Skills | Effort | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 4 (2 meta + 2 core) | 10-15h | ðŸ”œ Next |
| **Phase 2: Core Skills** | 6 core | 18-30h | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| **Phase 3: Extensions** | 8 specialized | 24-40h | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| **Phase 4: Polish** | Docs + public release | 8-15h | ðŸ“‹ Planned |

**Total**: 60-100 hours over 8-9 weeks

---

## Phase 1 Exit Criteria

- âœ… All 4 skills pass RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- âœ… Meta-skills route correctly to core skills
- âœ… Cross-references work (threat-modeling â†” documentation-structure)
- âœ… Personal use validated on real scenario
- âœ… Committed to git with clear messages

---

## What Success Looks Like

**After Phase 1**: Foundation proven, can load meta-skills to route to core skills
**After Phase 2**: Universal core skills usable across any project
**After Phase 3**: Specialized extensions for high-security/regulated environments
**After Phase 4**: Public-quality skill packs ready for community use

---

## Design Principles

1. **Layered**: Core (universal) + Extensions (specialized)
2. **Modular**: Load only what you need
3. **Cross-Referenced**: Bidirectional knowledge graph
4. **TDD for Documentation**: Every skill tested before deployment
5. **Meta-Aware**: Teach patterns, not exhaustive lists

Example: `compliance-awareness-and-mapping` teaches "frameworks vary by jurisdiction" + discovery process, NOT hardcoded list of all frameworks.

---

## Origin Story

Designed alongside **Elspeth** (security-first LLM orchestration platform) but universal and reusable. Informed by:
- Bell-LaPadula MLS enforcement
- ADR-quality documentation practices
- TDD-based complexity reduction methodology
- High-security/regulated environment patterns

**Applies to any project** - web apps, mobile, embedded, data pipelines, etc.

---

## Future Vision (Not Current Scope)

**Web of complementary skill packs**:
- security-architect + technical-writer (current)
- performance-engineer + reliability-engineer (future)
- data-architect + privacy-engineer (future)

Each pack: universal core + extensions, bidirectional cross-references.

## Getting Help

**Lost?** Read in order:
1. This file (status)
2. planning/GETTING_STARTED.md (workflow)
3. planning/2025-10-28-security-architect-technical-writer-design.md (complete context)

**Stuck?** Review:
- `superpowers:writing-skills` for methodology
- `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` for testing approach
- planning/GETTING_STARTED.md "Common Mistakes" section

---

## Ready to Start?

```bash
# In new repo
cat planning/GETTING_STARTED.md  # Read implementation guide
cat planning/2025-10-28-security-architect-technical-writer-design.md  # Read full design

# Announce skill usage
"I'm using the writing-skills skill to create security-architect/using-security-architect."

# Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
# Commit when done
# Move to next skill
```

**You have everything you need. Trust the process. Ship one skill at a time.**

---

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1, Skill 1 (`ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect`)
