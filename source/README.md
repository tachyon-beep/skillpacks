## What This Is

Universal skill packs for Claude Code providing:
- **security-architect**: Threat modeling, security controls, architecture review, secure patterns, classified systems, compliance, authorization

## Quick Start for Claude

**When you arrive in new repo, read in this order:**

1. **This file** (README.md) - Status and quick start
2. **planning/GETTING_STARTED.md** - Implementation workflow and critical reminders
3. **planning/2025-10-28-security-architect-technical-writer-design.md** - Complete design (10,000 words, every skill detailed)

**Then start implementing:**
```
I'm using the writing-skills skill to create ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect.
```

---

## Critical Reminders

### The Iron Law
```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

### Required Skills to USE
- `superpowers:using-superpowers` (mandatory first)
- `superpowers:writing-skills` (skill creation methodology)
- `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` (testing approach)

### Workflow Per Skill
```
RED (baseline test WITHOUT skill)
  â†“
GREEN (write skill addressing failures)
  â†“
REFACTOR (close loopholes under pressure)
  â†“
COMMIT (one skill at a time)
```

## Repository Independence

This project is **orthogonal to Elspeth** (the project where it was designed). It has:
- âœ… Complete design documentation
- âœ… Implementation workflow
- âœ… Testing methodology
- âœ… Phase-by-phase plan
- âœ… Zero dependencies on Elspeth codebase

**Claude can work independently with ONLY contents of this repo.**

## What Success Looks Like

**After Phase 1**: âœ… Foundation proven, can load meta-skills to route to core skills
**After Phase 2**: âœ… Universal core skills usable across any project
**After Phase 3**: âœ… Specialized extensions for high-security/regulated environments
**After Phase 4**: ðŸ“‹ Public-quality skill packs ready for community use

---

## Design Principles

1. **Layered**: Core (universal) + Extensions (specialized)
2. **Modular**: Load only what you need
3. **Cross-Referenced**: Bidirectional knowledge graph
4. **TDD for Documentation**: Every skill tested before deployment
5. **Meta-Aware**: Teach patterns, not exhaustive lists

Example: `compliance-awareness-and-mapping` teaches "frameworks vary by jurisdiction" + discovery process, NOT hardcoded list of all frameworks.

---

## Origin Story

Designed alongside **Elspeth** (security-first LLM orchestration platform) but universal and reusable. Informed by:
- Bell-LaPadula MLS enforcement
- ADR-quality documentation practices
- TDD-based complexity reduction methodology
- High-security/regulated environment patterns

**Applies to any project** - web apps, mobile, embedded, data pipelines, etc.

---

## Future Vision (Not Current Scope)

**Web of complementary skill packs**:
- security-architect + technical-writer (current)
- performance-engineer + reliability-engineer (future)
- data-architect + privacy-engineer (future)

Each pack: universal core + extensions, bidirectional cross-references.
