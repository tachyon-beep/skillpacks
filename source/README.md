# Security Architect & Technical Writer Skill Packs

**Status**: Phase 2 Complete! Core Skills Proven, Moving to Phase 3
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Packs**: 2 (security-architect, technical-writer)
**Total Skills**: 16 (2 meta + 8 core + 6 extensions)

---

## What This Is

Universal skill packs for Claude Code providing:
- **security-architect**: Threat modeling, security controls, architecture review, secure patterns, classified systems, compliance, authorization
- **technical-writer**: Documentation structure, clarity, diagrams, testing, security-aware docs, incident response, governance, operational acceptance

**Key Innovation**: Layered architecture (universal core + specialized extensions) with bidirectional cross-references creating knowledge graph.

---

## Current Phase: Core Skills (Phase 2)

**Phase 1 Skills Progress** (Foundation - Meta + Initial Core):
1. âœ… `ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect` (meta-skill, routing) - **COMPLETE**

3. âœ… `ordis/security-architect/secure-by-design-patterns` (zero-trust, immutable) - **COMPLETE**
4. âœ… `muna/technical-writer/diagram-conventions` (decision tree, semantic labels) - **COMPLETE**
5. âœ… `ordis/security-architect/security-architecture-review` (systematic checklists) - **COMPLETE**
6. âœ… `muna/technical-writer/documentation-testing` (5 dimensions: completeness, accuracy, findability, examples, walkthrough) - **COMPLETE**

**Phase 2 Complete!** All 6 core skills implemented with rigorous RED-GREEN-REFACTOR testing. Universal skills applicable to any project.

**Total Effort (Phase 1 + 2)**: ~25 hours

## Quick Start for Claude

**When you arrive in new repo, read in this order:**

1. **This file** (README.md) - Status and quick start
2. **planning/GETTING_STARTED.md** - Implementation workflow and critical reminders
3. **planning/2025-10-28-security-architect-technical-writer-design.md** - Complete design (10,000 words, every skill detailed)

**Then start implementing:**
```
I'm using the writing-skills skill to create ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect.
```

---

## Critical Reminders

### The Iron Law
```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

### Required Skills to USE
- `superpowers:using-superpowers` (mandatory first)
- `superpowers:writing-skills` (skill creation methodology)
- `superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents` (testing approach)

### Workflow Per Skill
```
RED (baseline test WITHOUT skill)
  â†“
GREEN (write skill addressing failures)
  â†“
REFACTOR (close loopholes under pressure)
  â†“
COMMIT (one skill at a time)
```

## Repository Independence

This project is **orthogonal to Elspeth** (the project where it was designed). It has:
- âœ… Complete design documentation
- âœ… Implementation workflow
- âœ… Testing methodology
- âœ… Phase-by-phase plan
- âœ… Zero dependencies on Elspeth codebase

**Claude can work independently with ONLY contents of this repo.**

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Skills | Effort | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 4 (2 meta + 2 core) | 10-15h | âœ… Complete |
| **Phase 2: Core Skills** | 6 core | 18-30h | âœ… Complete |
| **Phase 3: Extensions** | 8 specialized | 24-40h | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| **Phase 4: Polish** | Docs + public release | 8-15h | ðŸ“‹ Planned |

**Total**: 60-100 hours over 8-9 weeks
**Completed**: ~25 hours (Phases 1-2)
**Remaining**: ~35-75 hours (Phases 3-4)

## Phase 1 Exit Criteria (âœ… Complete)

- âœ… All 4 skills pass RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- âœ… Meta-skills route correctly to core skills
- âœ… Cross-references work (threat-modeling â†” documentation-structure)
- âœ… Personal use validated on real scenario
- âœ… Committed to git with clear messages

## Phase 2 Exit Criteria (âœ… Complete)

- âœ… All 6 core skills pass RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- âœ… Skills applicable across different project types (APIs, services, pipelines, docs)
- âœ… Security skills complement writing skills (bidirectional cross-references)
- âœ… Each skill tested with baseline â†’ skill â†’ verification cycle
- âœ… Committed to git with detailed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR messages

## What Success Looks Like

**After Phase 1**: Foundation proven, can load meta-skills to route to core skills
**After Phase 2**: Universal core skills usable across any project
**After Phase 3**: Specialized extensions for high-security/regulated environments
**After Phase 4**: Public-quality skill packs ready for community use

---

## Design Principles

1. **Layered**: Core (universal) + Extensions (specialized)
2. **Modular**: Load only what you need
3. **Cross-Referenced**: Bidirectional knowledge graph
4. **TDD for Documentation**: Every skill tested before deployment
5. **Meta-Aware**: Teach patterns, not exhaustive lists

Example: `compliance-awareness-and-mapping` teaches "frameworks vary by jurisdiction" + discovery process, NOT hardcoded list of all frameworks.

---

## Origin Story

Designed alongside **Elspeth** (security-first LLM orchestration platform) but universal and reusable. Informed by:
- Bell-LaPadula MLS enforcement
- ADR-quality documentation practices
- TDD-based complexity reduction methodology
- High-security/regulated environment patterns

**Applies to any project** - web apps, mobile, embedded, data pipelines, etc.

---

## Future Vision (Not Current Scope)

**Web of complementary skill packs**:
- security-architect + technical-writer (current)
- performance-engineer + reliability-engineer (future)
- data-architect + privacy-engineer (future)

Each pack: universal core + extensions, bidirectional cross-references.
