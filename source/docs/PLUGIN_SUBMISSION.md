---

## Local Testing Before Submission

Test the plugin thoroughly in your local environment before marketplace submission.

### Step 1: Validate plugin.json

Ensure plugin manifest is valid JSON:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool plugin.json > /dev/null && echo "Valid JSON" || echo "Invalid JSON"
```

Expected output: `Valid JSON`

Verify all 18 skills are listed:

```bash
cat plugin.json | python3 -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'Skills listed: {len(data[\"skills\"])}')"
```

Expected output: `Skills listed: 18`

### Step 2: Test Meta-Skills Load

Meta-skills route to appropriate core and extension skills. Test both:

```
I'm using ordis/security-architect/using-security-architect to help me
decide which security skill I need for threat analysis.
```

Verify: Meta-skill loads and can recommend threat-modeling skill.

```
I'm using muna/technical-writer/using-technical-writer to help me
decide which documentation skill I need for API documentation.
```

Verify: Meta-skill loads and can recommend documentation-structure skill.

### Step 3: Test Core Skills (Spot Check)

Test that core skills from each faction load and work:

**Security Architecture Core Skill:**
```
I'm using ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling to analyze this REST API
authentication endpoint for security threats.
```

Verify: Skill loads, STRIDE methodology is available, can analyze threats.

**Technical Writer Core Skill:**
```
I'm using muna/technical-writer/documentation-structure to create an API
reference documentation template.
```

Verify: Skill loads, ADR patterns available, can generate documentation templates.

### Step 4: Test Extension Skills (Spot Check)

Test specialized extension skills to ensure they work:

**Security Architecture Extension:**
```
I'm using ordis/security-architect/classified-systems-security to design
a system that handles classified data following Bell-LaPadula model.
```

Verify: Skill loads, Bell-LaPadula MLS patterns available.

**Technical Writer Extension:**
```
I'm using muna/technical-writer/incident-response-documentation to create
runbooks for our incident response process.
```

Verify: Skill loads, 5-phase response template available.

### Step 5: Test Cross-References Between Skills

Verify that skills can reference each other:

```
I'm using ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling to analyze our API,
and I want to know which security controls to design next.
```

Verify: The skill references `security-controls-design` and that reference works.

```
I'm using ordis/security-architect/security-controls-design and I need to
document my controls with traceability to threats.
```

Verify: The skill references `documenting-threats-and-controls` and works.

### Step 6: Verify File Structure

Ensure plugin package has correct structure:

```bash
# Check plugin.json exists in root
ls -la plugin.json

# Check PLUGIN_README.md exists in root
ls -la PLUGIN_README.md

# Verify all skill paths from plugin.json exist
# Example for one skill:
ls -la ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling/

# Should contain SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter:
# ---
# name: threat-modeling
# description: [description]
# ---
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: plugin.json validation fails

**Symptoms:** Error when validating JSON

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for JSON syntax errors
python3 -m json.tool plugin.json

# Common issues:
# - Trailing comma in last array element
# - Missing quotes around string values
# - Tab characters instead of spaces
```

**Fix:** Use a JSON linter to identify and fix syntax errors.

### Issue: Skill doesn't load from marketplace

**Symptoms:** Plugin loads but skill returns "not found" error

**Solution:**
1. Verify path in plugin.json matches actual file location
   ```bash
   # Check path in plugin.json
   cat plugin.json | grep "ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling"

   # Verify file exists
   ls -la ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Confirm file paths use forward slashes (not backslashes)
3. Ensure no extra whitespace in paths

**Fix:** Update plugin.json with correct path, retest, resubmit.

### Issue: Cross-reference between skills doesn't work

**Symptoms:** Skill A references Skill B but reference fails to load

**Solution:**
1. Verify reference uses correct skill path format
   ```markdown
   **Use WITH this skill:**
   - `ordis/security-architect/security-controls-design`
   ```

2. Test reference manually:
   ```
   I'm using ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling
   Can you also explain ordis/security-architect/security-controls-design?
   ```

3. Check that referenced skill exists and loads independently

**Fix:** Correct reference path, test, resubmit plugin.

### Issue: YAML frontmatter not parsed correctly

**Symptoms:** Skill loads but metadata (name, description) missing

**Solution:**
1. Verify frontmatter structure:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Skill description here
   ---
   ```

2. Check formatting:
   - Frontmatter must start at first line (no blank line before)
   - Must have `---` on separate lines
   - Use spaces, not tabs in YAML
   - Name and description are required fields

3. Test file format:
   ```bash
   head -5 ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling/SKILL.md
   # Should show frontmatter with ---
   ```

**Fix:** Correct YAML frontmatter format, retest, resubmit.

### Issue: Marketplace submission rejected

**Symptoms:** Submission rejected with feedback

**Solutions by Issue Type:**

**"Skills not loading"**
- Test each skill locally first
- Verify all paths in plugin.json are correct
- Ensure SKILL.md files exist with proper frontmatter

**"Description insufficient"**
- Provide more detail about what skills do
- Include use cases and target audience
- Reference key capabilities and frameworks

**"Missing documentation"**
- Ensure PLUGIN_README.md is complete
- Include examples of skill usage
- Provide clear installation instructions

**"License issue"**
