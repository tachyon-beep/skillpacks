# Phase 4: Public Release Design

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Design Complete, Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Effort:** 8-14 hours (conservative: 10-14h, realistic: 8-12h)

---

## Overview

Transform skillpacks from "Phase 3 complete" (18 skills, personally usable) to "public-ready open-source project" supporting:
- **Distribution:** Both GitHub repository and Claude Code plugin marketplace
- **Audience:** Security professionals, technical writers, AND developers learning these domains
- **Community:** Full open-source contribution model (PRs welcome)
- **Examples:** 5 end-to-end tutorials showing realistic usage

---

## Current State (Post-Phase 3)

**Assets:**
- 18 skills (2 meta + 8 core + 8 extensions)
- All tested with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology
- security-architect pack: 10 skills
- technical-writer pack: 8 skills
- Complete skill documentation with real-world examples
- ~45-50 hours invested

**Gaps for Public Release:**
- README optimized for implementation, not public discovery
- No contribution guidelines
- No plugin packaging
- No end-to-end tutorials (skills have examples, but no complete scenarios)
- No governance files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, issue templates)

---

## Design: Three Sequential Waves

### Wave 1: Repository Polish (4-5 hours)

**Goal:** Make repository welcoming and navigable for public audience (experts + learners).

#### README.md Restructure

**Current README:** Implementation-focused, great for context during development
**New README:** Public-facing, discovery-focused

**Move to DEVELOPMENT.md:**
- Phase 1/2/3 implementation details
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR testing methodology
- Development workflow and git commit patterns

**New README Structure:**
```markdown

#### CONTRIBUTING.md

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Contributing to Security Architect & Technical Writer Skills

## How to Propose a New Skill

1. **Create GitHub issue first** using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_skill.md`
   - Describe skill purpose
   - Explain when it should be used
   - Identify which faction (ordis/muna/axiom/bravos/lyra/yzmir)

2. **Wait for maintainer feedback** before implementing
   - Ensures skill fits architecture
   - Avoids duplicate effort

## Skill Creation Requirements

All skills MUST follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD methodology:

### RED Phase: Baseline Test Without Skill
- Create realistic scenario
- Test Claude WITHOUT your skill
- Document what it misses, gets wrong, or does inefficiently
- Objective measurement of baseline failures

### GREEN Phase: Create Skill Addressing Failures
- Write skill addressing documented failures
- Include real-world examples
- Add cross-references to related skills
- YAML frontmatter with name and description

### REFACTOR Phase: Verification Test With Skill
- Test Claude WITH your skill
- Verify all baseline failures addressed
- Test under pressure (time constraints, edge cases)
- Document real-world impact

### Required Skill Components
- Clear "When to Use" section
- "Symptoms you need this" (trigger patterns)
- "Don't use for" (anti-patterns)
- Real-world examples (3+ concrete examples)
- Cross-references (use WITH, use AFTER sections)
- Real-World Impact section (proven effectiveness)

## Faction Organization

Skills grouped thematically by Altered TCG-inspired factions:
- **Ordis** (Protectors of Order): Security, governance, compliance
- **Muna** (Weavers of Harmony): Documentation, synthesis, clarity
- **Axiom** (Creators of Marvels): Tooling, infrastructure, automation
- **Bravos** (Champions of Action): Practical tactics, execution
- **Lyra** (Nomadic Artists): UX, creative, design
- **Yzmir** (Magicians of Mind): Theory, algorithms, architecture

See [FACTIONS.md](FACTIONS.md) for details.

## Style Guide

- Markdown formatting
- YAML frontmatter: `name` and `description` fields
- Code blocks with language tags
- Decision trees using markdown tables or ASCII art
- Cross-references: Use relative paths (e.g., `ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling`)

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork repository
2. Create feature branch (`git checkout -b skill/my-new-skill`)
3. Implement skill with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR testing
4. Commit with detailed message documenting testing phases
5. Create PR using `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

### PR Checklist
- [ ] RED-GREEN-REFACTOR testing complete
- [ ] Real-world examples included
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
- [ ] Testing documentation in commit message

## Code Review

Maintainers will review:

- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology followed
- Examples are realistic and complete
- Writing is clear and actionable
- Cross-references are accurate

## Questions?

Open GitHub issue or discussion.

## Timeline

**Conservative Estimate:** 10-14 hours
- Wave 1: 4-5 hours
- Wave 2: 2-3 hours
- Wave 3: 4-6 hours

**Realistic Estimate:** 8-12 hours (with momentum from Phases 1-3)
- Wave 1: 3-4 hours (pattern established)
- Wave 2: 2-3 hours (straightforward packaging)
- Wave 3: 3-5 hours (tutorials leveraging existing skill examples)

---

## Success Metrics

**User Success:**
- New user finds skillpacks via GitHub/marketplace → Understands value in <2 minutes → Loads skill → Gets result in <5 minutes
- Contributor interested in adding skill → Reads CONTRIBUTING.md in <10 minutes → Creates issue → Gets feedback → Implements with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR

**Project Success:**
- GitHub stars/forks indicate interest
- Plugin downloads indicate usage
- GitHub issues/discussions indicate engagement
- Pull requests indicate contribution health

**Quality Metrics:**
- All skills follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology
- All tutorials have realistic scenarios and concrete outcomes
- Documentation serves both experts (quick reference) and learners (step-by-step)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Plugin marketplace submission process unknown**
- **Mitigation:** Document process in Wave 2, even if actual submission delayed
- **Impact:** GitHub distribution works immediately, plugin follows when approved

**Risk 2: Tutorials take longer than estimated**
- **Mitigation:** Start with 3 tutorials (API security, healthcare, incident response) as MVP, add 2 more (government ATO, cross-cutting) if time permits
- **Impact:** 3 tutorials still demonstrate realistic usage across domains

**Risk 3: Community contributions slow to start**
- **Mitigation:** Clear CONTRIBUTING.md lowers barrier, issue templates guide proposals
- **Impact:** Skills are valuable even without community contributions initially

---

## Next Steps After Phase 4

**Phase 5 (Future - Not Part of Current Scope):**
- Monitor community feedback and usage
- Address bug reports and feature requests
- Consider additional tutorial topics based on user demand
- Expand to additional faction skillpacks (axiom/bravos/lyra/yzmir)
- Translate skills to other languages (if international interest)

**Phase 4 delivers complete, public-ready skillpacks. Future phases are community-driven.**
