## Step 1: Threat Modeling (ordis/security-architect/threat-modeling)

### Context
Before we write any documentation, we must understand what we're protecting and from whom. Threat modeling is the foundation of all subsequent security work.

### Threat Modeling Approach: STRIDE

Using STRIDE, we identify threats across six categories:

**1. Spoofing (Identity)**
- Threat: Attackers impersonate legitimate API clients
- Assets: API credentials, OAuth tokens, mTLS certificates
- Risk: Unauthorized transaction processing, fraud

**2. Tampering (Data)**
- Threat: Attackers modify transactions in transit
- Assets: Payment request payloads, cryptographic signatures
- Risk: Amount manipulation, redirect to attacker accounts

**3. Repudiation (Accountability)**
- Threat: Clients deny making payments they authorized
- Assets: Transaction logs, audit trails, digital signatures
- Risk: Fraud disputes, regulatory violations

**4. Information Disclosure**
- Threat: Card data, customer PII exposed through logs/errors
- Assets: Card data (PAN), CVV, SSN, email addresses
- Assets: Database backups, error messages, logs
- Risk: Data breach, GDPR fines, PCI DSS violations

**5. Denial of Service**
- Threat: Attackers flood API with requests, disabling payments
- Assets: API endpoints, payment processors
- Risk: Revenue loss, SLA violations, customer dissatisfaction

**6. Elevation of Privilege**
- Threat: Attackers gain admin access or higher privileges
- Assets: API keys with high permissions, admin accounts
- Risk: Complete system compromise, data exfiltration

### Key Threats for Payment Processing

**High Severity:**
1. Unauthorized API access via compromised credentials
2. Card data exposure in logs/errors
3. Man-in-the-middle attacks on transaction data
4. SQL injection via transaction parameters
5. Privilege escalation in multi-tenant architecture

**Medium Severity:**
1. DDoS attacks on payment endpoints
2. Weak cryptographic implementation
3. Insecure data at rest in backups
4. Inadequate access controls for sensitive operations

**Low Severity:**
1. Information disclosure in error messages
2. Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Threat Asset Mapping

| Asset | Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Card Data (PAN) | Exposure in logs | Breach, GDPR fines | Medium | HIGH |
| API Credentials | Theft, compromise | Unauthorized access | Medium | HIGH |
| Transaction Data | Tampering in transit | Fraud, disputes | Low | HIGH |
| Customer PII | Unauthorized access | Identity theft | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Authentication tokens | Replay attacks | Impersonation | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Admin credentials | Brute force | Full compromise | Low | CRITICAL |

## Step 3: Security-Aware Documentation (muna/technical-writer/security-aware-documentation)

### Audience Segmentation & Content

Different audiences need different security information:

### A. External API Documentation (Public)

**Audience:** Third-party developers integrating PaySecure payments

**Security Topics to Cover:**
1. Authentication & API key management
2. PCI DSS compliance responsibility sharing
3. Secure coding practices for integrations
4. Data handling requirements
5. Incident reporting procedures

**Example Public API Documentation:**

```markdown
# PaySecure Payment API Documentation

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys.

### API Key Management

1. Generate API keys in the Dashboard
2. Store keys securely (environment variables, not code)
3. Rotate keys every 90 days
4. Revoke immediately if compromised

**NEVER commit API keys to version control.**

### Example Request

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://api.paysecure.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "customer_id": "cust_12345",
    "description": "Order #12345"
  }'
\`\`\`

### Security Requirements for Integrations

**Data Handling:**
- NEVER log card data, even partial PAN
- DO tokenize cards immediately
- DO use HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+)
- DO implement request signing for high-value transactions

**Error Handling:**
- DO NOT return sensitive data in error messages
- DO return generic error messages to end users
- DO log detailed errors securely for debugging

**Compliance Responsibility:**
PaySecure handles PCI DSS compliance for payment processing.

### Threat-to-Control Mapping

| Threat | Control | PCI DSS Req | Evidence | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Card data exposure | PAN tokenization | 3.2, 3.4 | Token logs | Continuous |
| Credential compromise | MFA for admin | 8.3, 8.5 | MFA logs | Continuous |
| Transaction tampering | TLS encryption | 4.1 | SSL scans | Monthly |
| Unauthorized access | API key rotation | 2.2.3 | Rotation logs | Quarterly |
| Data breach | Audit logging | 10.2 | Log review | Daily |

## Control Implementation Details

### PAN Tokenization (Req 3.2, 3.4)

**Implementation:**
```
1. Payment API receives card data via encrypted channel
2. Tokenization service (separate HSM) generates unique token
3. Token returned to merchant
4. Card data destroyed immediately
5. Tokens used for subsequent transactions
```

**Evidence Location:**
- `/security/tokenization-architecture.pdf` - Detailed flows
- `logs/tokenization/*.log` - Token generation records
- `audit/pci-compliance/tokenization-evidence/` - Third-party reports

**Verification Procedure:**
```
Weekly:
1. Scan database for PAN patterns
2. Verify zero results (except processor HSM)
3. Run automated PAN detection in backups
4. Generate evidence report for auditors
```

### API Key Rotation (Req 2.2.3)

**Implementation:**
```
1. API keys expire every 90 days
2. Clients notified 30 days before expiration
3. New key generation via secure dashboard
4. Old key continues working for 7 days (grace period)
5. Automatic revocation after grace period
```

**Evidence Location:**
- `audit/api-keys/rotation-schedule.csv` - Rotation timeline
- `logs/api-gateway/key-rotation.log` - Rotation events
- `reports/quarterly-key-rotation-report.pdf` - Summary

### TLS Configuration (Req 4.1)

**Implementation:**
```
Minimum: TLS 1.2 (no SSLv3, TLS 1.0, 1.1)
Ciphers: AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 only
HSTS: Enabled, 365-day max-age
Certificate: DigiCert EV, pinned in mobile apps
```

**Evidence Location:**
- `infrastructure/tls-config.yaml` - Configuration baseline
- `audit/tls-scans/` - Monthly SSL Labs reports
- `incident/tls-weaknesses/` - Any policy exceptions

## Known Limitations & Compensating Controls

### Limitation: Key Escrow for Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Issue:** Encryption keys held centrally for tenant isolation.
**Risk:** Rogue admin could access other tenants' data.
**Compensating Control:**
- Dual control: 2-person authorization required for key access
- Audit logging: All key access logged with identity, timestamp
- Quarterly review: Unauthorized access attempts reviewed
- Evidence: Access logs, dual-control approval forms

### Limitation: Cold-Start Key Material

**Issue:** Database encryption keys stored in code (startup)
**Risk:** Code repository compromise exposes keys
**Compensating Control:**
- Keys in separate sealed vault (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
- Code has only key references (key IDs, not material)
- Vault access requires MFA + IP whitelist
- Evidence: Vault access logs, code scans showing no key material

## Audit Evidence Procedures

### Monthly Controls Review

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Review authentication logs for anomalies
- [ ] Verify TLS configuration unchanged
- [ ] Run PAN detection scanning
- [ ] Review access logs for unauthorized attempts
- [ ] Check backup encryption status

## Detailed Threat-Control Documentation

### Threat T1: Card Data Exposure in Logs

**Description:**
Sensitive cardholder data (PAN, CVV, track data) could be logged during error handling or debugging, violating PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and 10.7.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Developer implements payment validation with logging
2. Validation fails on test card number
3. Developer logs entire request including card data for debugging
4. Log files retained indefinitely
5. Insider or compromised account accesses logs
6. Card data exposed

**Mitigating Controls:**

**Control 1: PAN Tokenization (Req 3.2, 3.4)**
- Card data replaced with unique token immediately
- Database contains zero PANs except in PCI-certified processor account
- Evidence:
  - Data flow diagram showing tokenization at boundary
  - Tokenization service logs (daily token generation)
  - Database schema audit (quarterly, verifies no PAN columns)
  - Processor certification document (annual)
- Responsible: Data Security Team
- Verification Frequency: Weekly automated scanning
- Test Procedure: Run PAN regex against entire codebase and logs

**Control 2: Log Redaction Rules (Req 3.4, 10.7)**
- Automated PAN redaction in all application logs
- Redaction rules: [0-9]{13,19} → [REDACTED]
- Applied at logging framework level, not application level
- Evidence:
  - Redaction rules configuration file
  - Log scanning results (zero PANs found)
  - Test cases showing redaction working
- Responsible: Data Security Team
- Verification Frequency: Daily (automated)

**Control 3: Encrypted Log Storage & Retention (Req 3.4, 10.7)**

- Logs retained for 12 months
- Logs older than 12 months cryptographically destroyed
- Access restricted to security team + auditors only
- Evidence:
  - Encryption configuration audit
  - Log retention policy document
  - Key rotation logs (quarterly)
  - Access logs for log system
- Responsible: Operations Team
- Verification Frequency: Monthly

**Combined Control Effectiveness:**
- Preventive: Tokenization prevents card data existence
- Preventive: Redaction prevents logging if breach occurs
- Detective: Weekly scanning identifies any breaches
- Recovery: Encrypted storage limits exposure even if accessed
- Overall Risk Reduction: 99%+ (Near impossible to expose card data)

### Threat T2: Unauthorized API Access via Stolen Credentials

**Description:**
Attackers could steal API credentials and make unauthorized transactions, violating PCI DSS Requirements 2.2.3, 8.2, and 8.3.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker compromises developer's laptop
2. Attacker steals API key from environment variable
3. Attacker uses key to call transaction endpoint
4. Unauthorized payments processed before detection
5. Financial loss + regulatory investigation

**Mitigating Controls:**

**Control 1: Unique API Keys per Client (Req 2.2.3)**
- Each API client gets unique key (not shared)
- Keys used for audit trail isolation
- Allows revoking specific client without affecting others
- Evidence:

  - Hardware security key approval (something unique)
- MFA required even for internal network access
- Evidence:
  - MFA policy document
  - MFA enrollment records
  - Successful MFA authentication logs
  - Failed MFA attempt analysis
- Responsible: Identity & Access Team
- Verification Frequency: Continuous monitoring
- Test Procedure: Attempt access without MFA (should fail)

**Control 4: API Rate Limiting (Req 11.3)**
- Each API key limited to 1,000 requests/minute
- Excessive requests result in 429 response + temporary block
- Blocks tracked and alerted on
- Evidence:
  - Rate limiting configuration
  - Rate limit enforcement logs
  - Alert triggers
  - Blocked IP/key analysis
- Responsible: Platform Engineering
- Verification Frequency: Daily monitoring
- Test Procedure: Attempt 5,000 requests/minute (should hit limit)

**Control 5: Audit Logging of API Access (Req 10.2, 10.3)**
- Every API call logged with:
  - Client ID (which API key)
  - Timestamp (when)
  - Endpoint (what action)
  - Parameters (sanitized)
  - Result (success/failure)
  - Response time
- Logs retained 12+ months
- Logs analyzed for anomalies (unusual patterns, brute force)
- Evidence:
  - Audit log schema
  - Sample audit logs
  - Log integrity verification (signatures)
  - Anomaly detection rules
- Responsible: Security Operations

## Overview

This guide describes how to safely manage API keys for PaySecure API.

**Key Principles:**
- Each application gets unique API key
- Keys automatically rotate every 90 days
- Keys must never be committed to version control
- Compromised keys must be reported immediately

## For API Developers

### Generating Your API Key

1. Log in to [PaySecure Dashboard](https://dashboard.paysecure.com)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** → **Generate New**
3. Name your key (e.g., "Production Payment Service")
4. Select scopes (e.g., "payments:write", "customers:read")
5. Click **Generate**
6. **Copy key immediately** - you won't see it again

### Storing Your API Key Securely

**DO:**
- Store in environment variables (`PAYSECURE_API_KEY`)
- Store in secure secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Restrict access to secrets (principle of least privilege)
- Rotate keys every 90 days

**DON'T:**
- Hardcode in source code
- Commit to version control (GitHub, GitLab)
- Share via email or chat
- Log the full key in error messages
- Use same key across environments (dev, staging, prod)

### Example: Secure Storage in Node.js

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.PAYSECURE_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('PAYSECURE_API_KEY environment variable not set');
}

const paysecure = new PaySecureClient({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  // DO NOT log or expose this key
});
```

### Detecting Compromised Keys

If you suspect a key is compromised:

1. **Revoke immediately:**
   - Dashboard → API Keys → [Your Key] → Revoke
   - This takes effect instantly

2. **Generate replacement:**
   - Dashboard → API Keys → Generate New
   - Update your application with new key
   - Redeploy (you have 7-day grace period)

3. **Report to PaySecure:**
   - Email security@paysecure.com with:
     - When compromise occurred (if known)
     - Affected services

## For Internal Security Team

### Key Rotation Process (Quarterly)

**Automated Process:**
1. System identifies keys reaching 90-day age
2. System generates new key
3. System notifies key owner via email
4. New key generated; old key marked "deprecated"
5. 7-day grace period (both keys work)
6. After 7 days, old key automatically revoked

**Manual Verification (Monthly):**
- [ ] Verify no key older than 100 days in system
- [ ] Verify rotation notifications sent
- [ ] Verify deprecated keys revoked after grace period
- [ ] Document in audit log

**Evidence Location:**
```
/audit/api-keys/rotation-schedule.csv
/logs/api-gateway/key-rotation.log
/reports/quarterly-key-rotation-report.pdf
```

### Access Control (PCI DSS Req 2.2.3, Req 7.1)

Only these roles can manage API keys:
- Platform Engineers (create/revoke for own service)
- Security Ops (audit, enforce rotation)
- Incident Response (revoke compromised keys)

**Approval Workflow for High-Privilege Keys:**
1. Engineer requests key with scope
2. Security team reviews scope for appropriateness
3. If approved: Key generated, logged
4. If denied: Requester notified with reason

**Audit Trail:**
- All key generation: /logs/key-management/generate.log
- All key revocation: /logs/key-management/revoke.log
- All key rotation: /logs/key-management/rotate.log
- Log retention: 12+ months

### Compromised Key Incident Response

**Detection:**
- Automated: Unusual volume from single key (> 10x normal)
- Manual: User reports suspicious activity
- Security: Audit process discovers unauthorized access

**Response Procedure (PCI DSS Req 6.4.3):**
1. Incident commander notified
2. Key immediately revoked (within 5 minutes)
3. Audit logs reviewed (last 24 hours)
4. Affected customers contacted
5. Forensic analysis completed
6. Post-incident review within 48 hours

**Forensic Analysis Checklist:**
- [ ] Extract API logs for compromised key (24 hours before/after)
- [ ] Identify unauthorized transactions
- [ ] Check if key accessed admin endpoints (unauthorized)
- [ ] Calculate financial impact
- [ ] Document timeline
- [ ] Preserve evidence (signed logs)

**Regulatory Notification:**
- If fraudulent transactions detected:
  - Notify card networks within 30 days (PCI DSS Req 12.8.2)
  - Notify state regulators within 30 days
  - Notify affected cardholders (if required)

## Compliance Mapping

| Control | PCI DSS Req | SOC 2 Criterion | Evidence |

**Status:** MITIGATED ✓ (Risk reduced from CRITICAL to LOW)

- **Preventive Controls:** Tokenization (99%+ prevention)
- **Detective Controls:** Log scanning (weekly, 100% coverage)
- **Compensating Controls:** Encryption (defense in depth)
- **Test Results:** Zero PANs found in scanning (50M+ log entries analyzed)
- **Conclusion:** Card data exposure essentially eliminated

### Threat: Unauthorized API Access

**Status:** MITIGATED ✓ (Risk reduced from CRITICAL to MEDIUM)

- **Preventive Controls:** MFA (prevents 95% of attacks), API key rotation (limits exposure window)
- **Detective Controls:** Audit logging (100% of API calls logged), Rate limiting (blocks brute force)
- **Compensating Controls:** Incident response procedure (rapid remediation)
- **Test Results:** Brute force protection working (tested: 1000 attempts blocked)
- **Conclusion:** Unauthorized access becomes very expensive and easily detected

### Threat: Data Tampering in Transit

**Status:** MITIGATED ✓ (Risk reduced from HIGH to LOW)

- **Preventive Controls:** TLS 1.2+ (cryptographic protection), Certificate pinning (prevents MITM)
- **Detective Controls:** Audit logging (captures any tampering attempts)
- **Test Results:** SSL Labs A+ rating, No weak ciphers detected
- **Conclusion:** Tampering essentially impossible with TLS 1.2+ and strong ciphers
