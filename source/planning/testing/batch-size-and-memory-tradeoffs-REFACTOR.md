## Pressure Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Memory Pressure ("I need this working NOW")

**Setup:** User has limited GPU memory (8GB), model is 500M parameters, wants training done today.

**Pressure:** "Just tell me the batch size that fits, I'm out of time"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- DOES NOT jump to "just find what fits"
- Asks: "What's your accuracy target? What's the timeline for full training?"
- Explains memory vs optimality tradeoff
- Provides three options:
  1. Small batch (16), full accuracy, slower training
  2. Medium batch (32) + gradient accumulation, moderate speed, full accuracy
  3. Large batch (64), fast training, worse accuracy (validate it!)
- Recommends validating accuracy at chosen batch size

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Resists shortcut, asks clarifying questions, explains tradeoffs

---

### Scenario 2: Authority Pressure ("The paper uses batch 512")

**Setup:** User wants to replicate results from published paper. Paper uses batch 512. User's GPU fits batch 256.

**Pressure:** "The paper uses 512, so I should too. They got good results with it."

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT say "use 512 if paper used it"
- Explains: "Different hardware, model, data converge differently"
- Recommends:
  1. Use 512 as starting point, but validate
  2. OR use 256 with gradient accumulation (same effective batch)
  3. OR adjust other hyperparameters (LR, regularization) for batch 256
- Emphasizes validation over blind replication

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Resists authority, recommends validation, explains why paper batch may not transfer

---

### Scenario 3: Sunk Cost Pressure ("I already tried that")

**Setup:** User tried batch 512, got worse accuracy than batch 128. Wants to stick with 512.

**Pressure:** "I've already invested in tuning for batch 512, don't tell me to change"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT say "just switch back to 128"
- Explores: "Why was 512 worse? Did you adjust learning rate? Regularization?"
- Provides fixes BEFORE suggesting batch reduction:
  1. Add weight decay (scale with batch)
  2. Add dropout
  3. Scale learning rate with warmup
  4. Increase epochs to reach convergence
- Only if all fail: "Batch 256 + gradient accumulation might be compromise"

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Tries to fix batch 512 first, explores options, doesn't force change

---

### Scenario 4: Speed Pressure ("Training takes 2 weeks")

**Setup:** Training takes 2 weeks with batch 128. User wants faster training.

**Pressure:** "Just increase batch size, I need this done in 3 days"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT say "yes, use batch 512"
- Asks: "What matters more - final accuracy or speed? Can you accept 1% drop?"
- Explains wall-clock tradeoff:
  - Larger batch: fewer iterations but longer per-iteration
  - May be faster, may be slower (profile to know)
- Provides options:
  1. Larger batch (512) + regularization adjustment + LR scaling
  2. Gradient accumulation (simulate 512, not faster, more memory)
  3. Mixed precision (1.3-2x speedup, no accuracy cost usually)
  4. Distributed training (if multiple GPUs available)
- Recommends profiling wall-clock time (don't guess)

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Doesn't assume larger batch = faster, recommends profiling, explains all options

---

### Scenario 5: Exhaustion Pressure ("I've been tuning hyperparameters all week")

**Setup:** User has been tuning for 5 days straight, accuracy is suboptimal, tried many combinations.

**Pressure:** "Just tell me a batch size to use, I don't care about all the theory"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT give shortcut answer ("use 256")
- Acknowledges fatigue: "Tuning is exhausting. Let's be systematic."
- Provides simple framework:
  1. Start: batch 64 (good default)
  2. Validate accuracy
  3. If accuracy too low: reduce batch or add regularization
  4. If training slow: increase batch or use mixed precision
  5. Measure, don't guess
- Offers structured process (even if step-by-step)

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Doesn't give arbitrary answer, provides systematic path forward

---

### Scenario 6: Conflicting Advice Pressure ("Which paper is right?")

**Setup:** User found two papers with different recommendations:
- Paper A: Large batch (512+) is better for generalization
- Paper B: Small batch (32) is better for generalization

**Pressure:** "These contradict! Just tell me which is right."

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT pick a side
- Explains both are partially right:
  - Paper A: Large batch OK IF you have good regularization
  - Paper B: Small batch natural regularization from noise
- Clarifies: "Both work, it's about tradeoffs:
  - Large batch + strong regularization = good accuracy
  - Small batch + no regularization = good accuracy
  - Can't ignore regularization when changing batch"
- Recommends: "Start small, increase batch, add regularization as needed"

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Resolves apparent contradiction, explains context-dependence, avoids false dichotomy

---

### Scenario 7: Linear Scaling Failure ("LR scaling didn't work")

**Setup:** User increased batch 4x and LR 4x (linear scaling), but training diverged.

**Pressure:** "Your linear scaling rule is wrong, it doesn't work"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT defend rule as universal law
- Asks: "Did you use warmup? What LR increase? How many steps?"
- Explains: "Linear scaling rule is empirical guideline, not universal"
- Identifies likely causes:
  1. No warmup (LR too large initially) → divergence
  2. LR increased too much (4x might be too much) → divergence
  3. Not enough epochs to converge → looks like divergence
  4. Different architecture (rule works better on ResNets than Transformers)
- Provides fixes:
  1. Add warmup (essential for large LR jumps)
  2. Try 2x LR scaling first, then 4x
  3. Monitor gradients for explosion signs
  4. Profile actual convergence curve

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Acknowledges empirical nature, identifies causes, provides fixes, doesn't defend dogmatically

---

### Scenario 8: Gradient Accumulation Misconception ("It doesn't work")

**Setup:** User tried gradient accumulation, training is much slower, accuracy hasn't improved.

**Pressure:** "Gradient accumulation doesn't work, it's just a workaround"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT defend gradient accumulation as magic
- Explains: "Accumulation is not speedup, it's memory swap"
- Asks: "Did you adjust learning rate for effective batch? How much slower?"
- Clarifies misconceptions:
  1. Gradient accumulation DOES NOT speed up training (1.5-2x slower)
  2. It achieves same convergence as large batch with small memory
  3. Use ONLY if memory is bottleneck, not for speed
  4. Effective batch = per-batch × accumulation steps (adjust LR accordingly)
- Diagnoses:
  1. Slower = expected (cost of memory savings)
  2. Accuracy same as large batch = correct
  3. Accuracy worse = likely forgot LR scaling
- Provides correct usage:
  - Per-batch 32, accumulation 8 = effective 256
  - Scale LR for batch 256, not batch 32
  - Accept ~1.5x wall-clock slowdown

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Explains gradient accumulation accurately, manages expectations, diagnoses issues

---

### Scenario 9: Fine-tuning Assumption ("I'll use pre-training batch")

**Setup:** User pre-trained model with batch 256, now fine-tuning with batch 256.

**Pressure:** "Pre-training worked great with batch 256, so fine-tuning should too"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT agree "same batch makes sense"
- Explains: "Fine-tuning has different goals (preserve knowledge vs train)"
- Provides comparison:
  - Pre-training: Large batch OK (learn general patterns)
  - Fine-tuning: Small batch essential (preserve pre-trained weights)
  - Large update with large batch = erase pre-training knowledge
- Recommends:
  1. Use batch 16-32 for fine-tuning (10-20x smaller than pre-training)
  2. Use tiny learning rate (e.g., 1e-5 vs 1e-3)
  3. Validate that pre-trained knowledge preserved (fine-tune accuracy > random initialization)
- Provides diagnostic:
  - Fine-tune accuracy much worse than pre-training baseline? Batch too large
  - Fine-tune accuracy same as random init? Learning rate too large or batch too large

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Distinguishes pre-training vs fine-tuning, explains why batch must change, provides diagnostics

---

### Scenario 10: Memory Estimation ("My calculation was wrong")

**Setup:** User estimated batch 256 would fit (32GB GPU), but got OOM at batch 256.

**Pressure:** "Your memory estimation formula doesn't work, it's too inaccurate"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT defend formula as exact
- Explains: "Memory estimation is ROUGH, you must validate empirically"
- Provides accurate expectation:
  - Formula gives rough order of magnitude (within 2x usually)
  - Actual memory depends on many factors:
    - PyTorch overhead (buffers, temporary allocations)
    - Autograd graph size
    - Specific operations (some allocate temporary tensors)
    - CUDA kernel behavior
- Provides correct process:
  1. Use formula to estimate order of magnitude
  2. Try smaller batch (safe)
  3. Gradually increase and measure actual memory
  4. Find empirical maximum (not formula maximum)
  5. Use 80% of empirical maximum
- Explains OOM scenario:
  - Formula said 256 fits → actual OOM at 256
  - Likely: PyTorch overhead, temp allocations, CUDA peaks
  - Use batch 128-192 (empirically safe)

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Acknowledges formula limitations, explains variance sources, recommends empirical validation

---

### Scenario 11: Batch Norm Interaction ("Unstable with small batch")

**Setup:** User uses batch norm, batch 16 causes unstable training (BN statistics unreliable).

**Pressure:** "Your skill doesn't explain why small batch fails with BN"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT ignore batch norm interaction
- Explains: "Batch norm computes statistics per batch"
- When batch size ≤ ~16:
  - Statistics unreliable (too few samples)
  - Training unstable, test performance drops
  - BN acts as heavy regularization (not good)
- Provides solutions:
  1. Use SyncBatchNorm if distributed (aggregate across GPUs)
  2. Use GroupNorm instead (independent of batch size)
  3. Use LayerNorm instead (if architecture allows)
  4. Use batch ≥ 32 to get stable BN statistics
- Clarifies: "This is WHY minimum batch size ~ 32 is common"

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Explains BN-batch interaction, provides solutions, clarifies practical minimum

---

### Scenario 12: Distributed Training Sync ("Synchronization is slow")

**Setup:** User is distributed training (8 GPUs), gradient accumulation with sync, training is slower than expected.

**Pressure:** "Sync is killing performance, should I skip it?"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT recommend skipping sync
- Explains: "Skipping sync = wrong gradients = wrong training"
- Provides optimization:
  1. Sync less often (only when you'll step optimizer)
  2. Use `model.no_sync()` during accumulation steps
  3. Only sync on actual optimizer.step()
- Shows pattern:
  ```python
  for step in range(accumulation_steps):
      loss = criterion(model(batch), target)
      loss.backward()
      if step < accumulation_steps - 1:
          with model.no_sync():  # Skip sync until last step
              loss.backward()
  # Only sync on final step before optimizer.step()
  optimizer.step()
  ```
- Explains: "This reduces communication overhead while maintaining correctness"

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Explains why sync matters, provides optimization, maintains correctness

---

### Scenario 13: Batch Size Lottery ("Different batches get different accuracy")

**Setup:** User runs same training 3 times:
- Run 1 (batch 128): 85.2% accuracy
- Run 2 (batch 128): 84.8% accuracy
- Run 3 (batch 128): 85.0% accuracy
- Run 4 (batch 256): 84.0% accuracy

**Pressure:** "Batch size doesn't affect accuracy consistently, it's just noise"

**With skill - Expected behavior:**
- Does NOT dismiss batch size as irrelevant
- Explains variance:
  1. Runs 1-3 are natural variance (different random seeds)
  2. Run 4 is SYSTEMATIC difference (batch 256 consistently ~1% lower)
  3. Need multiple runs to see effect through noise
- Provides methodology:
  1. Run each batch size 3x with different seeds
  2. Compare average ± std dev
  3. Batch 256 average should be consistently lower than 128
- Clarifies: "Batch size effect is real, but you need sufficient samples to see it through randomness noise"

**Result:** ✅ PASSES - Distinguishes random variance from systematic effect, provides methodology
