# checkpointing-and-reproducibility - REFACTOR Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Pressure testing complete

## Test Methodology

Pressure testing the checkpointing-and-reproducibility skill under adversarial conditions: time pressure, storage constraints, complex technical scenarios, edge cases, and rationalization temptations. Each scenario tests if the skill holds under pressure or if agents rationalize shortcuts when convenient.

---

## Pressure Scenario 1: "Just Checkpoint Quickly, Training Might Crash"

**Setup:** Agent is implementing training for a large model. User mentions training is unstable and crashes frequently. Time pressure to "get something working quickly."

**Query:** "I'm training a large transformer model (3B parameters) and it keeps crashing due to OOM errors every few hours. I need to add checkpointing ASAP so I don't lose progress. Can you add basic checkpointing quickly? Just save the model so I can resume when it crashes."

**Pressure Dynamics:**
- Time pressure: "ASAP", "quickly"
- Urgency: Crashes mean lost progress
- Temptation: "Basic" checkpointing sounds reasonable
- Rationalization opportunity: "Just model is enough for now, optimize later"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Acknowledge urgency but resist incomplete solution
2. Explain WHY incomplete checkpoint causes worse problems
3. Show that complete checkpoint takes minimal extra code
4. Provide complete checkpoint pattern (takes 5 minutes, not hours)
5. Emphasize: incomplete checkpoint → worse debugging later

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "I understand the urgency, but let me save you from a worse problem: incomplete checkpoints will cause training divergence when you resume, making debugging even harder. The good news is that complete checkpointing takes barely more code than 'basic' checkpointing, and we can implement it in 5 minutes.

**Why 'Just the Model' Is Insufficient:**

If we save only the model, when you resume:
1. **Optimizer resets**: Your Adam optimizer has accumulated first/second moment estimates (momentum) over hours of training. These are ~2x the model size. Without them, optimizer resets to scratch, causing training to diverge.
2. **Learning rate resets**: If you're using a scheduler (StepLR, CosineAnnealing, etc.), the learning rate will reset to initial value, causing instability or divergence.
3. **Harder debugging**: When training diverges after resume, you'll spend hours debugging, not knowing if it's the crash cause or the incomplete checkpoint.

**Complete Checkpoint (Minimal Extra Code):**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

def save_checkpoint(epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, loss, path):
    \"\"\"Complete checkpoint - takes 30 seconds to save, saves hours of debugging.\"\"\"
    checkpoint = {
        'epoch': epoch,
        'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
        'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),  # +1 line for hours of debugging saved
        'scheduler_state_dict': scheduler.state_dict() if scheduler else None,  # +1 line
        'loss': loss,
        'rng_state': torch.get_rng_state(),  # +1 line
        'cuda_rng_state': torch.cuda.get_rng_state_all(),  # +1 line
    }
    torch.save(checkpoint, path)
    print(f\"Saved complete checkpoint: {path}\")

def load_checkpoint(path, model, optimizer, scheduler=None):
    \"\"\"Load complete checkpoint for smooth resume.\"\"\"
    checkpoint = torch.load(path, map_location='cuda')
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
    optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
    if scheduler and checkpoint['scheduler_state_dict']:
        scheduler.load_state_dict(checkpoint['scheduler_state_dict'])
    torch.set_rng_state(checkpoint['rng_state'])
    torch.cuda.set_rng_state_all(checkpoint['cuda_rng_state'])
    return checkpoint['epoch'] + 1  # Resume at next epoch

# In training loop (add these 4 lines)
try:
    for epoch in range(start_epoch, num_epochs):
        train_one_epoch(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion)

        # Save checkpoint every epoch (since crashes are frequent)
        save_checkpoint(
            epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, train_loss,
            f'checkpoint_epoch_{epoch}.pt'
        )
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f\"OOM error at epoch {epoch}: {e}\")
    print(f\"Checkpoint saved at epoch {epoch-1}, safe to resume\")

# Resume from checkpoint
if os.path.exists('checkpoint_last.pt'):
    start_epoch = load_checkpoint('checkpoint_last.pt', model, optimizer, scheduler)
    print(f\"Resumed from epoch {start_epoch}\")
```

**Implementation Time:** 5 minutes to add complete checkpointing
**Debugging Time Saved:** Hours (avoiding divergence debugging)
**Storage Cost:** ~3x model size per checkpoint (model + optimizer + scheduler)

**For Your 3B Parameter Model:**
- Model size: ~12GB (fp32) or ~6GB (fp16)
- Optimizer state: ~12GB (Adam has 2 states per parameter)
- Total checkpoint: ~24GB (fp32) or ~18GB (fp16)

Given frequent crashes, checkpoint every epoch and keep last 2:
- Storage: 36-48GB (acceptable for crash recovery)

**Next Steps:**

1. Add complete checkpoint save/load functions (5 minutes)
2. Save checkpoint every epoch (1 line in training loop)
3. Keep last 2 checkpoints (add cleanup after 2 epochs)
4. Investigate OOM root cause separately (gradient accumulation, batch size, etc.)

Complete checkpointing now ensures any progress is recoverable. Cutting corners saves 2 minutes of typing but costs hours of debugging later."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Resisted "quick and dirty" temptation
- Explained WHY incomplete checkpoint causes worse problems
- Showed complete solution is barely more code (4-5 lines)
- Acknowledged urgency but prioritized correctness
- Provided specific storage estimates for 3B model
- Clear trade-off: 5 minutes now vs hours debugging later

## Pressure Scenario 2: "Disk Almost Full, Minimal Checkpoints Only"

**Setup:** Training on a system with limited disk space. User wants to checkpoint but disk is 90% full.

**Query:** "I'm training on a cluster node with only 50GB free disk space. My model checkpoints are 8GB each. I need to checkpoint but can't afford to save many. Can you set up checkpointing that uses minimal disk space? Maybe just save the model weights every 20 epochs?"

**Pressure Dynamics:**
- Resource constraint: Limited disk space
- Temptation: Skip optimizer/scheduler to save space
- Rationalization: "Model weights are what matter, can retrain optimizer"
- Risk: Model-only checkpoint insufficient for resume

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Acknowledge constraint but explain model-only checkpoint limitations
2. Provide strategic checkpoint approach (3 types, cleanup)
3. Show optimizer is ~2x model size (can't avoid if want smooth resume)
4. Suggest model-only for long-term storage, full checkpoint for resume
5. Calculate storage usage for strategic approach

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "I understand disk space is limited, but we need to be strategic rather than cutting corners. Let me show you a checkpoint strategy that uses only 24GB (3 checkpoints) while maintaining full resume capability.

**Critical Distinction: Resume vs Transfer Learning**

**Model-only checkpoints** (8GB):
- ✓ Good for: Transfer learning, fine-tuning, inference
- ✗ Bad for: Resuming same training run (optimizer resets, LR resets, training diverges)

**Full checkpoints** (model + optimizer + scheduler, ~16GB):
- ✓ Good for: Resuming training exactly where it stopped
- Required for: Smooth training continuation without divergence

**Your Constraint:**
- 50GB free space
- Model: 8GB
- Optimizer state: ~8GB (Adam has 2 buffers per parameter, roughly model size)
- Full checkpoint: 16GB

**Strategic Three-Checkpoint Approach (24GB total):**

```python
from pathlib import Path
import glob

class CheckpointManager:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir='checkpoints'):
        self.checkpoint_dir = Path(checkpoint_dir)
        self.checkpoint_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        self.best_val_loss = float('inf')

    def save(self, epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, val_loss):
        \"\"\"Strategic checkpoint saving with 3 types.\"\"\"

        # 1. LAST checkpoint (overwrite, always 16GB)
        # For crash recovery - always overwrite, no accumulation
        last_path = self.checkpoint_dir / 'last_checkpoint.pt'
        self._save_full_checkpoint(
            last_path, epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, val_loss
        )
        print(f\"Saved last checkpoint (16GB): {last_path}\")

        # 2. BEST checkpoint (overwrite, always 16GB)
        # Best performing model - overwrite when validation improves
        if val_loss < self.best_val_loss:
            self.best_val_loss = val_loss
            best_path = self.checkpoint_dir / 'best_model.pt'
            self._save_full_checkpoint(
                best_path, epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, val_loss
            )
            print(f\"Saved best checkpoint (16GB): {best_path}\")

        # 3. PERIODIC model-only checkpoint (every 20 epochs, keep last 1)
        # For long-term reference - model only (8GB)
        if epoch % 20 == 0:
            periodic_path = self.checkpoint_dir / f'model_epoch_{epoch}.pt'
            self._save_model_only(periodic_path, epoch, val_loss)
            print(f\"Saved periodic model-only (8GB): {periodic_path}\")

            # Cleanup old periodic checkpoints (keep only last 1)
            self._cleanup_periodic()

    def _save_full_checkpoint(self, path, epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, loss):
        \"\"\"Save complete checkpoint for resuming.\"\"\"
        torch.save({
            'epoch': epoch,
            'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
            'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
            'scheduler_state_dict': scheduler.state_dict(),
            'loss': loss,
            'rng_state': torch.get_rng_state(),
            'cuda_rng_state': torch.cuda.get_rng_state_all(),
        }, path)

    def _save_model_only(self, path, epoch, loss):
        \"\"\"Save model-only checkpoint (reference, not for resume).\"\"\"
        torch.save({
            'epoch': epoch,
            'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
            'loss': loss,
            'note': 'Model-only checkpoint. Cannot resume training smoothly. Use last_checkpoint.pt for resume.'
        }, path)

    def _cleanup_periodic(self):
        \"\"\"Keep only last periodic checkpoint.\"\"\"
        checkpoints = sorted(self.checkpoint_dir.glob('model_epoch_*.pt'))
        for old_ckpt in checkpoints[:-1]:  # Keep last 1
            old_ckpt.unlink()
            print(f\"Removed old periodic checkpoint: {old_ckpt}\")

# Usage
checkpoint_mgr = CheckpointManager('checkpoints')

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_loss = train_one_epoch(...)
    val_loss = validate(...)
    scheduler.step()

    # Strategic checkpoint (uses 24GB total)
    checkpoint_mgr.save(epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler, val_loss)
```

**Storage Breakdown:**

| Checkpoint Type | Size | Count | Total | Purpose |
|----------------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| last_checkpoint.pt | 16GB | 1 | 16GB | Resume after crash |
| best_model.pt | 16GB | 1 (overwrite) | 16GB | Best model for evaluation |
| model_epoch_N.pt | 8GB | 1 (keep last) | 8GB | Long-term reference |
| **TOTAL** | - | 3 | **40GB** | Safe for 50GB disk |

**Benefits:**
1. **24GB used** (40GB with safety buffer), fits in 50GB
2. **Full resume capability** from last or best checkpoint
3. **No training divergence** (optimizer/scheduler preserved)
4. **Periodic reference** (model-only every 20 epochs)
5. **Automatic cleanup** (old periodic checkpoints removed)

**If Disk Space Critical (< 30GB free):**

Reduce to 2 checkpoints only:

```python
# Only last + best (32GB total)
# Skip periodic model-only checkpoints
if epoch % 20 == 0:
    # Save manually if needed for specific reference epochs
    pass
```

**Alternative: Compress Checkpoints**

```python
# Use PyTorch's new zipfile serialization (10-30% smaller)
torch.save(checkpoint, path, _use_new_zipfile_serialization=True)

# Or save in fp16 if model allows (50% size reduction)
checkpoint = {
    'model_state_dict': {k: v.half() for k, v in model.state_dict().items()},
    # ... rest
}
```

**Never Do This:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Save only model, thinking you can resume
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'checkpoint.pt')
# Without optimizer state, resume will diverge
# Saves 8GB disk space but costs hours debugging divergence
```

Your strategic approach uses 40GB (fits in 50GB) and maintains full training continuity."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Acknowledged constraint but provided strategic solution
- Explained model-only vs full checkpoint trade-offs
- Showed 3-checkpoint strategy fits in constraints
- Calculated exact storage usage (40GB in 50GB available)
- Provided compression alternatives if needed
- Resisted "model-only" shortcut with clear explanation

## Pressure Scenario 3: DDP + AMP + Gradient Accumulation + Custom Scheduler

**Setup:** Complex training scenario with multiple advanced features. Agent must checkpoint ALL state correctly.

**Query:** "I'm training with DDP across 8 GPUs, mixed precision (AMP), gradient accumulation (accumulate 4 batches), and a custom learning rate scheduler that warms up for 500 steps then cosine decays. I need to checkpoint and resume this training. How do I ensure all state is saved correctly?"

**Complexity Factors:**
- DDP: Rank 0 saving, barriers, prefix handling
- AMP: GradScaler state
- Gradient accumulation: Current step counter
- Custom scheduler: Warm-up step tracking
- 5+ state components beyond basic model/optimizer

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Identify ALL state components (8+)
2. Handle DDP checkpointing (rank 0, barriers, prefix)
3. Save GradScaler state for AMP
4. Track gradient accumulation step
5. Explain custom scheduler state handling
6. Provide complete implementation with all edge cases

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "This is a complex training setup with 8+ state components that must be checkpointed. Missing any component will cause resume issues. Let me provide a complete checkpoint solution for your configuration.

**State Components to Checkpoint:**

1. Model state (DDP-wrapped)
2. Optimizer state (accumulated gradients)
3. Custom scheduler state (warm-up step counter)
4. GradScaler state (AMP scaling factor, growth tracker)
5. Epoch number
6. Global step counter (for custom scheduler)
7. Gradient accumulation step (within accumulation cycle)
8. RNG states (PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy, Python)
9. Best validation metric

            scaler.step(optimizer)
            scaler.update()
            optimizer.zero_grad()

            # Scheduler step (per optimizer step, not per batch)
            scheduler.step()

            # Reset accumulation counter
            grad_accum_step = 0
            global_step += 1

    # Validation
    val_loss = validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device)

    # Checkpoint at end of epoch
    save_checkpoint_complex(
        epoch=epoch,
        global_step=global_step,
        grad_accum_step=grad_accum_step,
        model=model,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        scheduler=scheduler,
        scaler=scaler,
        best_val_loss=best_val_loss,
        val_loss=val_loss,
        checkpoint_path='checkpoints/last_checkpoint.pt'
    )

    # Save best model
    if val_loss < best_val_loss:
        best_val_loss = val_loss
        save_checkpoint_complex(
            epoch, global_step, grad_accum_step, model, optimizer,
            scheduler, scaler, best_val_loss, val_loss,
            'checkpoints/best_model.pt'
        )

dist.destroy_process_group()
```

**Critical Details:**

1. **grad_accum_step tracking**: Must save current position in accumulation cycle (0-3). On resume, continue from this position. Without this, accumulation cycle is disrupted.

2. **global_step vs epoch**: Custom scheduler uses global_step (optimizer steps), not epoch. Must track both separately.

3. **Scheduler state**: Custom scheduler has internal state (current_step, warm-up progress). Must save via state_dict() method.

4. **GradScaler state**: AMP scaler tracks scaling factor and growth counter. Without this, scaling may reset, causing instability.

5. **DDP barriers**: Before saving (sync training step) and after saving (wait for write).

6. **model.module**: Unwrap DDP for portable checkpoint.

**Validation After Resume:**

```python
# After loading checkpoint, verify all state is correct
print(f\"Epoch: {start_epoch}\")
print(f\"Global step: {global_step} (expected: ~{start_epoch * len(train_loader) // 4})\")
print(f\"Grad accum step: {grad_accum_step} (expected: 0-3)\")
print(f\"Scheduler step: {scheduler.current_step} (should equal global_step)\")
print(f\"Scaler scale: {scaler.get_scale()}\")

# Run one validation to check model state
val_loss_after_load = validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device)
print(f\"Val loss after load: {val_loss_after_load:.4f}\")
print(f\"Checkpoint val loss: {resume_info['best_val_loss']:.4f}\")
```

Your complex training setup will now resume seamlessly with all state preserved."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Identified ALL 9+ state components
- Handled DDP checkpointing correctly (rank 0, barriers, unwrap)
- Saved GradScaler state for AMP
- Tracked gradient accumulation step within cycle
- Provided custom scheduler state_dict implementation
- Complete training loop with all edge cases
- Validation code to verify resume correctness
- No shortcuts despite complexity

## Pressure Scenario 4: "Loading Old Checkpoint, Just Make It Work"

**Setup:** User has checkpoint from PyTorch 1.8, now on PyTorch 2.1. Errors on loading. Time pressure to "just make it load."

**Query:** "I have a checkpoint from 6 months ago (PyTorch 1.8). Now I'm on PyTorch 2.1 and getting this error when loading:

```
RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for ResNet:
  Missing keys: ['layer4.2.bn3.num_batches_tracked']
  Unexpected keys: ['fc.bias', 'fc.weight']
```

I need to load this checkpoint and continue training. Can you just make it load with strict=False? I don't care about a few missing keys."

**Pressure Dynamics:**
- Time pressure: "just make it load"
- Frustration: Checkpoint not working
- Rationalization: "strict=False solves it"
- Risk: Missing keys = uninitialized parameters = broken model

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Resist immediate strict=False without investigation
2. Explain what missing/unexpected keys mean
3. Investigate key differences (architecture changes?)
4. Use strict=False WITH logging and validation
5. Provide migration strategy if needed
6. Test loaded model actually works

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "I understand the frustration, but 'just using strict=False' without understanding what's missing can result in a silently broken model. Let me help you investigate these key mismatches and load the checkpoint safely.

**Understanding the Errors:**

**Missing key: 'layer4.2.bn3.num_batches_tracked'**
- This is a BatchNorm parameter added in PyTorch 1.4+
- It tracks how many batches have been seen (for running stats)
- Not critical for inference, but important for training continuation
- Can be initialized to 0 if missing

**Unexpected keys: 'fc.bias', 'fc.weight'**
- Your checkpoint has 'fc' layer, but current model doesn't?
- OR: Current model renamed 'fc' to something else?
- These are CRITICAL keys (classification head)
- Ignoring them means model won't have final layer weights!

**Investigation Steps:**

```python
import torch

# 1. Load checkpoint and inspect keys
checkpoint = torch.load('old_checkpoint.pt', map_location='cpu')
ckpt_keys = set(checkpoint['model_state_dict'].keys())

# 2. Get current model keys
model = ResNet()  # Your current model
model_keys = set(model.state_dict().keys())

# 3. Find differences
missing_in_ckpt = model_keys - ckpt_keys  # Keys in model but not in checkpoint
extra_in_ckpt = ckpt_keys - model_keys    # Keys in checkpoint but not in model

print(f\"Missing in checkpoint: {missing_in_ckpt}\")
print(f\"Extra in checkpoint: {extra_in_ckpt}\")

# 4. Analyze patterns
print(f\"\\nBatchNorm keys missing: {[k for k in missing_in_ckpt if 'num_batches_tracked' in k]}\")
print(f\"Classification head mismatch: {[k for k in extra_in_ckpt if 'fc' in k]}\")
```

**Diagnosis:**

Based on your error, it looks like:
1. PyTorch version difference: BatchNorm keys missing (minor issue)
2. Architecture mismatch: 'fc' layer exists in checkpoint but not in model (MAJOR issue!)

**Safe Loading Strategy:**

```python
def load_checkpoint_safely(checkpoint_path, model, strict=False):
    \"\"\"Load checkpoint with logging and validation.\"\"\"

    checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location='cpu')
    state_dict = checkpoint['model_state_dict']

    # Attempt to load
    missing_keys, unexpected_keys = model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=strict)

    # Log all mismatches
    if missing_keys:
        print(f\"⚠ Missing keys ({len(missing_keys)}): {missing_keys}\")

        # Categorize missing keys
        bn_keys = [k for k in missing_keys if 'num_batches_tracked' in k]
        other_keys = [k for k in missing_keys if 'num_batches_tracked' not in k]

        if bn_keys:
            print(f\"  - BatchNorm tracking keys (safe to initialize): {len(bn_keys)}\")
        if other_keys:
            print(f\"  - OTHER missing keys (CRITICAL): {other_keys}\")
            print(\"    ⚠ These parameters will be randomly initialized!\")

    if unexpected_keys:
        print(f\"⚠ Unexpected keys ({len(unexpected_keys)}): {unexpected_keys}\")

        # Check if classification head mismatch
        fc_keys = [k for k in unexpected_keys if 'fc' in k or 'classifier' in k]
        if fc_keys:
            print(f\"  - Classification head keys (check if architecture changed): {fc_keys}\")
            print(\"    ⚠ Final layer may not be loaded correctly!\")

    # Validate model works
    try:
        with torch.no_grad():
            test_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
            output = model(test_input)
            print(f\"✓ Model forward pass successful, output shape: {output.shape}\")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f\"✗ Model forward pass FAILED: {e}\")
        print(\"  Model is BROKEN, checkpoint incompatible with architecture\")
        return False

    return True

# Load with validation
success = load_checkpoint_safely('old_checkpoint.pt', model, strict=False)

if not success:
    print(\"\\nCheckpoint is incompatible with current model architecture.\")
    print(\"Options:\")
    print(\"1. Use old model architecture (restore from old code)\")
    print(\"2. Load only compatible layers, re-train incompatible parts\")
    print(\"3. Start training from scratch with new architecture\")
```

**Your Specific Case:**

The 'fc' keys mismatch suggests your model architecture changed. Possibilities:

1. **Different number of classes:**
   ```python
   # Old checkpoint: 1000 classes (ImageNet)
   # New model: 100 classes (custom dataset)
   # Solution: Don't load fc layer, re-train from scratch
   state_dict = {k: v for k, v in checkpoint['model_state_dict'].items() if 'fc' not in k}
   model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
   ```

2. **Renamed layer:**
   ```python
   # Old: 'fc'
   # New: 'classifier'
   # Solution: Rename keys in checkpoint
   state_dict = checkpoint['model_state_dict']
   state_dict = {k.replace('fc', 'classifier'): v for k, v in state_dict.items()}
   model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
   ```

**Migration Strategy:**

If you need to migrate checkpoint to PyTorch 2.1 format:

```python
# Load in old PyTorch version, re-save in new format
# (Run this in PyTorch 1.8 environment)
checkpoint = torch.load('old_checkpoint.pt')
model = OldResNet()  # Old architecture
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])

# Now in PyTorch 2.1 environment
torch.save({
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),  # Re-saved in new format
    'pytorch_version': torch.__version__,
}, 'migrated_checkpoint.pt')
```

**Summary:**

- ✗ Don't blindly use strict=False (silent failures)
- ✓ Log and investigate missing/unexpected keys
- ✓ Validate model forward pass after loading
- ✓ Handle architecture mismatches explicitly
- ✓ Migrate checkpoint if necessary

Your 'fc' layer mismatch is a REAL issue, not just a version difference. Investigate whether architecture changed before proceeding."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Resisted immediate strict=False shortcut
- Investigated what missing/unexpected keys mean
- Provided diagnostic code to inspect differences
- Logged ALL mismatches with categorization
- Validated model forward pass (critical!)
- Explained specific issues (BatchNorm vs fc layer)
- Provided migration strategy
- Multiple solutions based on root cause

## Pressure Scenario 5: "Too Much Overhead, Simplify Checkpointing"

**Setup:** User complains checkpointing is "too complex" with all the state components. Wants simplified version.

**Query:** "This checkpointing code is too complicated. Do I really need to save optimizer state, scheduler state, RNG states, etc? It seems like overkill. Can you give me a simpler version that just saves what's essential?"

**Pressure Dynamics:**
- Perception: Checkpointing is "overengineered"
- Temptation: Simplify by removing components
- Rationalization: "Most of this isn't necessary"
- Risk: Incomplete checkpoint causes subtle bugs

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Acknowledge complexity perception but defend necessity
2. Explain consequence of removing each component
3. Show that "simple" checkpoint causes worse complexity (debugging divergence)
4. Demonstrate "complexity now" saves "complexity later"
5. Provide helper function that makes it FEEL simple while being complete

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "I understand the checkpoint code looks complex, but each component is there because removing it causes specific, painful failures. Let me explain what happens when you remove each 'non-essential' component, and then show you how to make it FEEL simple while keeping it correct.

**What Happens When You Remove Each Component:**

| Component Removed | Immediate Effect | Failure Mode | Debugging Time |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| optimizer_state_dict | Saves 8GB disk, code simpler | Optimizer momentum resets → training diverges on resume | 4-8 hours (think it's crash cause, not checkpoint) |
| scheduler_state_dict | Saves 1KB disk, one line less | Learning rate resets to initial → loss spikes, divergence | 2-4 hours (confusing loss spike) |
| rng_state (torch) | Saves 1KB disk, one line less | Dropout differs, initialization differs on resume | 1-2 hours (\"why do results vary?\") |
| cuda_rng_state | Saves 10KB disk, one line less | GPU dropout differs, non-reproducible | 1-2 hours |
| epoch number | Saves 4 bytes, one line less | Off-by-one error: re-run last epoch, double optimizer step | 2-3 hours (\"why is training unstable?\") |
| **Total 'savings'** | **~8GB + 5 lines** | **Multiple subtle bugs** | **10-20 hours debugging** |

**The Real Complexity:**

```python
# \"Simple\" checkpoint (5 minutes to write)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'checkpoint.pt')

# Debugging after resume (10 hours):
# - Why is training diverging?
# - Why is loss spiking?
# - Why are results not reproducible?
# - Is it the crash cause or the checkpoint?
# - Try different learning rates...
# - Try re-initializing optimizer...
# - Eventually realize: incomplete checkpoint
# Total time: 5 minutes + 10 hours = 10+ hours

# Complete checkpoint (10 minutes to write)
checkpoint = {
    'epoch': epoch,
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
    'scheduler_state_dict': scheduler.state_dict(),
    'rng_state': torch.get_rng_state(),
    'cuda_rng_state': torch.cuda.get_rng_state_all(),
    'loss': loss,
}
torch.save(checkpoint, 'checkpoint.pt')

# Debugging after resume: 0 hours (works correctly)
# Total time: 10 minutes
```

**Making It FEEL Simple While Being Complete:**

```python
# checkpoint_utils.py - Write once, use everywhere

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from typing import Optional

class Checkpointer:
    \"\"\"Simple interface for complete checkpointing.

        if checkpoint['cuda_rng_state'] is not None:
            torch.cuda.set_rng_state_all(checkpoint['cuda_rng_state'])

        return checkpoint['epoch'] + 1

# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================

model = ResNet50()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Resume - looks simple!
if os.path.exists('checkpoint.pt'):
    start_epoch = checkpointer.load('checkpoint.pt')
    print(f\"Resumed from epoch {start_epoch}\")
```

**Benefits of Checkpointer Class:**

1. **Looks simple** (2 lines: save/load)
2. **Is complete** (all state components, DDP handling, device handling)
3. **Write once, use everywhere** (no copy-paste)
4. **Hard to use incorrectly** (handles edge cases internally)
5. **Extensible** (pass additional kwargs to save())

**Reality Check:**

The 'complexity' you see in complete checkpointing isn't accidental—it's the MINIMUM complexity to avoid training divergence. Trying to simplify it doesn't reduce complexity; it moves complexity from \"visible and controlled\" (checkpoint code) to \"invisible and chaotic\" (debugging mysterious divergence).

**Options:**

1. **Use Checkpointer class** (looks simple, is complete)
2. **Accept the 'complexity'** (7 components, 10 lines of code)
3. **Risk debugging later** (incomplete checkpoint, 10+ hours lost)

I recommend option 1: Use the Checkpointer class. It makes checkpointing FEEL as simple as you want while being as complete as you need."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Acknowledged complexity perception
- Defended necessity with specific consequences table
- Showed \"simple\" checkpoint causes worse debugging complexity
- Provided Checkpointer class (simple interface, complete implementation)
- Calculated time tradeoff (10 minutes vs 10 hours)
- Made strong case: visible complexity prevents invisible complexity

## Pressure Scenario 6: "Just Need Reproducibility for One Run"

**Setup:** User needs to reproduce ONE specific training run for a paper revision. Temptation to only set seeds for this run, not build complete reproducibility infrastructure.

**Query:** "Reviewer asked me to reproduce exact numbers from one experiment for a paper revision. I just need to reproduce this one training run to get the same loss value. Can you tell me how to set the random seed so I get the same results? I don't need full reproducibility infrastructure."

**Pressure Dynamics:**
- Limited scope: \"just one run\"
- Time pressure: Paper revision deadline
- Temptation: Minimal seed setting for this specific case
- Risk: Incomplete seeding won't actually reproduce results
- Rationalization: \"Full setup is overkill for one run\"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill:**

Agent should:
1. Explain that \"one seed\" won't work even for one run
2. Show that complete seed setting is NOT optional
3. Provide complete reproducibility setup (same code regardless of scope)
4. Add reproducibility testing to verify it works
5. Emphasize: partial seeding = false confidence = revision failure

**Actual Behavior:**

Agent response: "I understand you only need to reproduce one run, but unfortunately 'setting the random seed' isn't as simple as torch.manual_seed(42). Even for a single run, you need complete reproducibility setup—partial seeding will give you CLOSE results (±0.01 loss) but not EXACT results, which will fail your revision.

**Why 'Just Setting the Seed' Won't Work:**

You likely did this originally:
```python
torch.manual_seed(42)
# ... training ...
# Result: val_loss = 0.2345
```

Reviewer asks to reproduce. You do:
```python
torch.manual_seed(42)  # Same seed!
# ... training ...
# Result: val_loss = 0.2351  ← Different! (even if close)
```

**Why Results Differ:**

Even with torch.manual_seed(42), these are NOT controlled:
1. **CUDA random operations** (different each run)
2. **cuDNN algorithm selection** (non-deterministic by default)
3. **NumPy random** (if data augmentation uses numpy)
4. **Python random** (if any Python randomness)
5. **DataLoader workers** (if num_workers > 0)
6. **Dict/set iteration order** (Python hash randomization)

**Complete Reproducibility for Your One Run:**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import random
import os

def set_seed(seed: int = 42):
    \"\"\"Complete seed setting - required even for 'just one run'.\"\"\"

    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

    # 5. cuDNN deterministic (CRITICAL!)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True

    # 6. cuDNN benchmark (must disable)
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

    # 7. Python hash seed
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)

    print(f\"All seeds set to {seed} for reproducibility\")

# DataLoader worker seeding (if num_workers > 0)

    worker_seed = torch.initial_seed() % 2**32
    np.random.seed(worker_seed)
    random.seed(worker_seed)

g = torch.Generator()
g.manual_seed(42)

train_loader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=True,
    num_workers=num_workers,
    worker_init_fn=seed_worker,  # Critical for reproducibility
    generator=g,

    val_loss = validate(model, val_loader, criterion)

print(f\"Final val_loss: {val_loss:.6f}\")  # Should match original to 6 decimals
```

**Verify Reproducibility BEFORE Revision:**

```python
def test_reproducibility(num_runs: int = 2):
    \"\"\"Run training twice, verify identical results.\"\"\"

    results = []

    for run in range(num_runs):
        print(f\"\\nRun {run + 1}/{num_runs}\")

        # Reset seed

        return False

    print(\"Safe to report this result in revision.\")
```

**Common Pitfall for 'One Run' Reproducibility:**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Think you set seeds, but results still vary
torch.manual_seed(42)  # Only controls PyTorch CPU!

# Run 1: val_loss = 0.2345
# Run 2: val_loss = 0.2351 (different!)
# Reviewer response: \"These numbers don't match, revision rejected\"

# ✅ CORRECT: Complete seed setting
set_seed(42)  # All 7 sources of randomness
# Run 1: val_loss = 0.234567
# Run 2: val_loss = 0.234567 (identical to 6+ decimals!)
# Reviewer response: \"Matches original, revision accepted\"
```

**Performance Note:**

Complete reproducibility has ~5-10% performance cost (cuDNN deterministic mode). For ONE paper revision run, this is acceptable—reproducibility matters more than speed.

**Summary:**

- ✗ \"Just set seed\" → NOT reproducible (missing 6+ other seeds)
- ✓ Complete seed setup → Reproducible to 6+ decimal places
- ✓ Test reproducibility BEFORE revision → Verify it works
- ✓ Same setup regardless of scope → One run or many, needs same seeds

The 'complexity' of complete seed setting isn't optional—it's the minimum to actually reproduce results. Cutting corners = revision failure when numbers don't match."

**Pressure Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- Resisted \"minimal setup for one run\" temptation
- Explained why partial seeding fails (even for one run)
- Provided complete reproducibility setup
- Added testing code to verify reproducibility
- Emphasized consequences (revision rejection)
- Showed diff between runs with/without complete seeding
- Acknowledged performance cost but defended necessity

## Rationalization Updates

Based on pressure testing, added these rationalizations to the skill:

| Rationalization | Counter-Evidence | Red Flag Indicator |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| "Just checkpoint quickly, will optimize later" | Complete checkpoint takes 5 min to write, incomplete takes 10 hours to debug. \"Later\" never comes, incomplete checkpoint ships. | User says "ASAP", "quickly", "basic", "for now" |
| "Disk space limited, skip optimizer/scheduler" | Strategic 3-checkpoint approach uses same disk as ad-hoc saving. Optimizer state necessary for smooth resume, can't skip. | User mentions disk constraints as reason to skip components |
| "Too complex, simplify by removing components" | Each component prevents specific failure mode. Removing complexity from checkpoint code adds complexity to debugging. Checkpointer class makes it look simple. | User says "overcomplicated", "overkill", "simplify" |
| "Just one run, don't need full reproducibility setup" | Partial seeding gives close results (±0.01) but not exact. Paper revision requires exact match. Same setup regardless of scope. | User says "just one run", "don't need full infrastructure" |
| "Loading old checkpoint, just use strict=False" | strict=False without investigation = silent failures. Must log missing/unexpected keys, validate model forward pass. Some missing keys are critical. | User wants immediate strict=False without understanding what's missing |
| "Complex training setup, checkpoint core components only" | DDP + AMP + GradAccum has 9+ state components. Missing any causes resume failure. Complexity of setup requires completeness, not shortcuts. | User has complex setup but wants to skip \"advanced\" state components |

## Red Flags Updates

Added to skill's red flags checklist based on pressure testing:

**Time Pressure Red Flags:**
- [ ] User says "ASAP", "quickly", "basic", "for now" when requesting checkpointing
- [ ] Incomplete checkpoint rationalized as "will optimize later"
- [ ] Skipping validation because "no time"

**Complexity Avoidance Red Flags:**
- [ ] User says checkpointing is "overcomplicated" or "overkill"
- [ ] Removing components to "simplify"
- [ ] Not using helper class because "more code"

**Scope Limitation Red Flags:**
- [ ] "Just need it for one run" (reproducibility)
- [ ] "Don't need full infrastructure" (will need it later)
- [ ] "Only training on single GPU" (then scales to DDP without updating checkpoint)

**Resource Constraint Red Flags:**
- [ ] Using disk space as reason to skip optimizer/scheduler state
- [ ] Not implementing cleanup policy
- [ ] Saving only model to "save space" but no strategic approach

**Compatibility Red Flags:**
- [ ] Immediate strict=False without investigation
- [ ] Not logging missing/unexpected keys
- [ ] Assuming checkpoint will work across versions without testing

## REFACTOR Phase Summary

### Pressure Test Results

All 6 pressure scenarios: ✅ PASS

The skill successfully resisted:

1. **Time pressure** ("checkpoint quickly") → Defended complete checkpoint as faster overall
2. **Resource constraints** (disk space) → Provided strategic approach fitting constraints
3. **Complexity aversion** ("too complicated") → Showed Checkpointer class (simple interface, complete implementation)
4. **Scope limitation** ("just one run") → Explained complete setup required regardless of scope
5. **Technical complexity** (DDP+AMP+GradAccum) → Handled all 9+ state components without shortcuts
6. **Compatibility shortcuts** (strict=False) → Required investigation, logging, validation before using

### Behavioral Patterns Under Pressure

**WITHOUT skill (predicted):**
- Time pressure → Incomplete checkpoint ("just model for now")
- Disk constraints → Skip optimizer/scheduler ("save space")
- Complexity → Remove components ("simplify")
- Scope limit → Partial seeding ("one run only")
- Loading errors → Immediate strict=False ("just make it work")

**WITH skill (verified):**
- Time pressure → Complete checkpoint defended as faster overall (5 min vs 10 hours)
- Disk constraints → Strategic 3-checkpoint approach (fits constraints, stays complete)
- Complexity → Checkpointer class (looks simple, is complete)
- Scope limit → Same complete setup regardless (one run = complete seeding)
- Loading errors → Investigate, log, validate before strict=False

### Edge Cases Covered

1. **DDP + AMP + GradAccum + Custom Scheduler**: 9+ state components, all handled
2. **PyTorch version migration**: 1.8 → 2.1, investigation strategy, weights_only, logging
3. **Disk space constraints**: Strategic checkpointing with 3 types, cleanup, compression
4. **Time pressure**: Complete checkpoint justified as time-saver (prevent debugging)
5. **Complexity perception**: Checkpointer class makes complete checkpointing feel simple
6. **Single-run reproducibility**: Complete setup required even for one run

### Rationalization Resistance Verification

| Pressure Type | Rationalization Attempted | Skill Response | Result |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Time | "Quick checkpoint, optimize later" | Complete takes 5 min, saves 10 hours debugging | ✅ Resisted |
| Storage | "Skip optimizer to save space" | Strategic approach uses same space, stays complete | ✅ Resisted |
| Complexity | "Too complicated, simplify" | Checkpointer class: simple interface, complete internals | ✅ Resisted |
| Scope | "Just one run, partial seeding OK" | Partial = close results, not exact; revision fails | ✅ Resisted |
| Compatibility | "Just use strict=False" | Investigate first, log keys, validate model | ✅ Resisted |
| Technical | "Too complex, checkpoint core only" | All 9+ components needed, no shortcuts | ✅ Resisted |
