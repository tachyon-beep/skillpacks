**Skill**: `yzmir/pytorch-engineering/custom-autograd-functions`
**Phase**: REFACTOR (Pressure Testing & Bulletproofing)
**Date**: 2025-10-30

## Purpose

Pressure test the custom-autograd-functions skill against edge cases, time pressure, complexity aversion, and rationalization traps. Identify gaps and strengthen the skill to be bulletproof under realistic constraints.

## Pressure Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Time Pressure - "Need Custom Op NOW"

**Context**: Production bug requires custom operation immediately. Agent under time pressure to deploy.

**User Request**:
> "URGENT: Production model failing because we need a custom gradient clipping operation in the middle of the network. Implement `forward: y = x * 2`, `backward: clip gradients to [-0.1, 0.1]` and DEPLOY NOW. We're losing $1000/minute."

**Pressure Points**:
- Extreme time pressure
- "Deploy now" urgency
- Financial pressure
- Temptation to skip gradcheck
- Temptation to use quick-and-dirty approach

**Rationalization Traps**:
> "No time for gradcheck, just test it quickly and deploy"
> "The gradient formula is simple, it'll work"
> "We can test in production, urgent fix needed"
> "gradcheck takes too long, customers waiting"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill**:
```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function, gradcheck

class ClippedGradientOp(Function):
    """
    Custom operation with gradient clipping.

    URGENT but STILL RUNNING GRADCHECK.
    gradcheck takes <1 second. Debugging production gradient bugs takes hours.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        return input * 2

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        # Clip gradients as requested
        grad_input = grad_output * 2
        grad_input = torch.clamp(grad_input, -0.1, 0.1)
        return grad_input

# Even under time pressure: gradcheck FIRST
def test_clipped():
    """
    Takes <1 second. Catches bugs before production.
    Time investment: 1 second now vs hours debugging later.
    """
    # Test without clipping first (verify formula)
    class UnclippedVersion(Function):
        @staticmethod
        def forward(ctx, input):
            return input * 2
        @staticmethod
        def backward(ctx, grad_output):
            return grad_output * 2

    input = torch.randn(10, 5, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)

    # Verify formula is correct
    assert gradcheck(
        UnclippedVersion.apply,
        (input,),
        eps=1e-6,
        atol=1e-4,
        raise_exception=True
    ), "Formula wrong - STOP, fix before deploy"
    print("✅ Formula correct (unclipped version passes)")

    # Test forward/backward runs
    input_test = torch.randn(10, 5, requires_grad=True)
    output = ClippedGradientOp.apply(input_test)
    output.sum().backward()
    assert input_test.grad is not None
    print("✅ Backward runs without error")

    print("\n✅ SAFE TO DEPLOY (took <1 second to verify)")

test_clipped()

# Time cost analysis:
# gradcheck: 1 second
# Production gradient bug debugging: hours to days
# ROI: 1 second investment prevents hours of debugging
```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Runs gradcheck even under extreme time pressure
- ✅ Explains gradcheck is fast (<1s), debugging is slow (hours)
- ✅ Tests unclipped version first (verify formula)
- ✅ Quick but correct verification workflow
- ✅ Resists "skip verification" rationalization

**Result**: Skill HOLDS under time pressure. gradcheck is non-negotiable.

### Scenario 2: Complexity Aversion - "Too Hard for Me"

**Context**: Agent feels custom autograd is "advanced" and avoids it when needed.

**User Request**:
> "I need to wrap this C++ CUDA kernel that computes `output = alpha * input^2 + beta`. The kernel is already written and works. I need it to work with PyTorch autograd for backprop. Help me integrate it."

**Pressure Points**:
- Seems advanced/intimidating
- External code (C++ kernel)
- "This is for experts only"
- Temptation to avoid or use hacky workaround

**Rationalization Traps**:
> "This is too complex for me, need expert help"
> "Can't I just use a normal function wrapper?"
> "Maybe I can avoid backprop through this layer"
> "Custom autograd is advanced, I'm not ready"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill**:
```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function, gradcheck

# Assume CUDA kernel is defined elsewhere:
# def cuda_kernel_forward(input, alpha, beta):
#     # C++ implementation: output = alpha * input^2 + beta
#     return output
#
# For testing, we'll use PyTorch equivalent:
def cuda_kernel_forward(input, alpha, beta):
    """Simulating CUDA kernel for testing."""
    return alpha * input ** 2 + beta

class CUDAKernelWrapper(Function):
    """
    Wrap external CUDA kernel in autograd-compatible function.

    Pattern is straightforward:
    1. Forward: call kernel
    2. Backward: derive gradient, implement math
    3. gradcheck: verify

    Not "advanced" - just a template to fill in.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input, alpha, beta):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input)
        ctx.alpha = alpha  # scalar, not tensor
        ctx.beta = beta    # scalar, not tensor

        # Call external CUDA kernel
        output = cuda_kernel_forward(input, alpha, beta)

        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        alpha = ctx.alpha

        # Derive gradient: d/dx[alpha * x^2 + beta] = 2 * alpha * x
        grad_input = grad_output * (2 * alpha * input)

        # No gradients for alpha/beta (they're parameters, not inputs)
        return grad_input, None, None

# Test with gradcheck
def test_cuda_wrapper():
    """
    Verify wrapper is correct.
    Takes 5 minutes to implement, works forever.
    """
    input = torch.randn(10, 5, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)
    alpha = 2.0
    beta = 1.0

    assert gradcheck(
        lambda x: CUDAKernelWrapper.apply(x, alpha, beta),
        (input,),
        eps=1e-6,
        atol=1e-4,
        raise_exception=True
    ), "Gradient wrong - check formula"
    print("✅ CUDA kernel wrapper correct")

test_cuda_wrapper()

# Pattern is simple:
# 1. Forward: call external code
# 2. Backward: implement gradient (just math)
# 3. gradcheck: verify
#
# Not advanced. Not intimidating. Just a template.
```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Demystifies "advanced" perception
- ✅ Provides simple template
- ✅ Shows it's just filling in math
- ✅ gradcheck verifies correctness
- ✅ "5 minutes to implement" framing

**Result**: Skill COUNTERS complexity aversion. Pattern is accessible.

---

### Scenario 3: "Gradient Looks Right" - Manual Verification

**Context**: Agent implements gradient, inspects it manually, declares it correct without gradcheck.

**User Request**:
> "Implement custom layer norm: `forward: (x - mean) / std`, backward: standard layer norm gradient formula (here's the math). I've checked the formula carefully, it's correct."

**Pressure Points**:
- Mathematical formula provided
- Looks correct on inspection
- "I checked it" confidence
- Temptation to skip numerical verification

**Rationalization Traps**:
> "The math is correct, I verified it on paper"
> "gradcheck is for when you're unsure, I'm confident"
> "Formula is standard, no need to test"
> "I tested it with a few values, looks good"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill**:
```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function, gradcheck
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayerNorm(Function):
    """
    Custom layer norm implementation.

    Even with "correct" math, implementation bugs happen:

        var = input.var(dim=-1, keepdim=True, unbiased=False)
        std = torch.sqrt(var + eps)

        # Normalize
        normalized = (input - mean) / std

        # Save for backward

    """
    input = torch.randn(4, 8, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)

# Lesson: Math correctness ≠ implementation correctness
# Paper verification ≠ numerical verification
# gradcheck is MANDATORY even when "certain"
```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Requires gradcheck even with "correct" math
- ✅ Explains implementation bugs vs math bugs
- ✅ Lists specific bugs gradcheck catches (dimensions, broadcasting, signs)
- ✅ Compares with PyTorch reference (additional verification)
- ✅ "Math correctness ≠ implementation correctness" message

**Result**: Skill ENFORCES gradcheck regardless of confidence. No exceptions.

---

### Scenario 4: Memory Pressure - "Must Optimize Memory"

**Context**: Training very large model, memory pressure forces optimization.

**User Request**:
> "I'm training a huge model and running out of memory. I need to implement gradient checkpointing for my custom 10-layer transformer block. Each layer has custom operations. Memory is critical - optimize aggressively."

**Pressure Points**:
- Memory constraints
- Complex multi-layer operation
- "Aggressive optimization" pressure
- Temptation to skip verification for performance

**Rationalization Traps**:
> "Checkpointing is complex, just save less and hope"
> "Can't afford gradcheck, it uses too much memory"
> "Recomputation is slow, maybe skip some layers"
> "Memory optimization is more important than verification"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill**:

```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Implements memory optimization correctly
- ✅ Tests with small scale BEFORE large model
- ✅ Runs gradcheck despite "memory pressure"
- ✅ Explains trade-offs (computation vs memory)
- ✅ "Correctness first, then optimize" approach

**Result**: Skill MAINTAINS verification even with memory constraints.

### Scenario 5: External Library with Approximate Gradients

**Context**: Wrapping external library that provides approximate gradients.

**User Request**:
> "I'm using a physics simulation library (external C++ code) that provides approximate gradients (finite differences internally). The gradients aren't exact but good enough for optimization. Wrap this in PyTorch autograd."

**Pressure Points**:
- Gradients are approximate (not exact)

    grad_x, = torch.autograd.grad(f, x, create_graph=True)

    # Compute Hessian-vector product: H @ v
    hvp, = torch.autograd.grad(grad_x, x, grad_outputs=v)

    print(f"   x: {x}")
    print(f"   v: {v}")
    print(f"   H @ v: {hvp}")

    # Verify: For quadratic form, Hessian is 2A
    expected_hvp = 2 * A @ v
    assert torch.allclose(hvp, expected_hvp, atol=1e-5), \
        "Hessian-vector product incorrect"
    print("✅ Hessian-vector product correct")

test_first_order()
test_second_order()
compute_hessian_vector_product()

# Lesson: Double backward is NOT "too advanced"
# 1. Implement backward() normally (return tensors that support backward)
# 2. Test with gradgradcheck
# 3. Use for meta-learning, Hessian computation, etc.
#
# Pattern is same as first-order. Not advanced. Not complicated.
```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Demystifies second-order derivatives
- ✅ Uses gradgradcheck for verification
- ✅ Shows pattern is same as first-order
- ✅ Provides concrete example (Hessian-vector product)
- ✅ "Not advanced, just same pattern" message

**Result**: Skill ENABLES higher-order derivatives by showing they're accessible.

### Scenario 7: Multiple Operations - "Save Time by Batching"

**Context**: Need to implement several custom operations, temptation to rush and batch verify.

**User Request**:
> "I need to implement 5 custom activation functions for an experiment: SwishBeta, Mish, GELU, ELU, and SELU. Implement them all as custom autograd functions so we have full control. We're on a deadline."

**Pressure Points**:
- Multiple operations (time pressure)
- Deadline pressure
- Temptation to implement all then test batch
- Temptation to skip gradcheck for "simple" ones

**Rationalization Traps**:
> "Implement all 5 first, then test them together"
> "Some are simple (ReLU-like), don't need gradcheck"
> "Batch testing is more efficient"
> "We're on a deadline, verification later"

**Expected Behavior WITH Skill**:
```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function, gradcheck

# CORRECT APPROACH: Implement, test, commit. ONE AT A TIME.

# 1. SwishBeta (first)
class SwishBeta(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, beta):
        sigmoid_beta_x = torch.sigmoid(beta * x)
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, beta, sigmoid_beta_x)
        return x * sigmoid_beta_x

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, beta, sigmoid_beta_x = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = grad_beta = None

        if ctx.needs_input_grad[0]:
            sigmoid_deriv = sigmoid_beta_x * (1 - sigmoid_beta_x)
            grad_x = grad_output * (sigmoid_beta_x + x * sigmoid_deriv * beta)

        if ctx.needs_input_grad[1]:
            sigmoid_deriv = sigmoid_beta_x * (1 - sigmoid_beta_x)
            grad_beta = (grad_output * x ** 2 * sigmoid_deriv).sum()

        return grad_x, grad_beta

def test_swish_beta():
    x = torch.randn(5, 4, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)
    beta = torch.tensor(1.0, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)
    assert gradcheck(SwishBeta.apply, (x, beta), eps=1e-6, atol=1e-4), "SwishBeta failed"
    print("✅ SwishBeta verified")

test_swish_beta()  # TEST NOW before moving on


# 2. Mish (second)
class Mish(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        softplus = torch.nn.functional.softplus(x)
        tanh_softplus = torch.tanh(softplus)
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, tanh_softplus, softplus)
        return x * tanh_softplus

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, tanh_softplus, softplus = ctx.saved_tensors

        sigmoid_x = torch.sigmoid(x)
        tanh_deriv = 1 - tanh_softplus ** 2

        grad_x = grad_output * (
            tanh_softplus + x * tanh_deriv * sigmoid_x
        )

        return grad_x

def test_mish():
    x = torch.randn(5, 4, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)
    assert gradcheck(Mish.apply, (x,), eps=1e-6, atol=1e-4), "Mish failed"
    print("✅ Mish verified")

test_mish()  # TEST NOW before moving on


# 3. CustomGELU (third)
class CustomGELU(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        # GELU approximation: 0.5 * x * (1 + tanh(sqrt(2/pi) * (x + 0.044715 * x^3)))
        import math
        coeff = math.sqrt(2.0 / math.pi)
        inner = coeff * (x + 0.044715 * x ** 3)
        tanh_inner = torch.tanh(inner)
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, tanh_inner, inner)
        ctx.coeff = coeff
        return 0.5 * x * (1 + tanh_inner)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, tanh_inner, inner = ctx.saved_tensors
        coeff = ctx.coeff

        # Complex derivative (exact formula derived)
        tanh_deriv = 1 - tanh_inner ** 2
        inner_deriv = coeff * (1 + 3 * 0.044715 * x ** 2)

        grad_x = grad_output * (
            0.5 * (1 + tanh_inner) +
            0.5 * x * tanh_deriv * inner_deriv
        )

        return grad_x

def test_custom_gelu():
    x = torch.randn(5, 4, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)
    assert gradcheck(CustomGELU.apply, (x,), eps=1e-6, atol=1e-4), "CustomGELU failed"
    print("✅ CustomGELU verified")

test_custom_gelu()  # TEST NOW before moving on


# Continue pattern for remaining activations...
# Each one: implement → test → verify → move on

print("\n✅ All activations implemented and verified")
print("   Pattern: implement ONE, test ONE, verify ONE")
print("   NOT: implement ALL, test ALL, debug ALL")
print("   Time investment: same total time, but bugs caught immediately")
```

**Skill Resistance Check**:
- ✅ Enforces one-at-a-time approach
- ✅ Tests each immediately after implementation
- ✅ Catches bugs before moving to next
- ✅ gradcheck non-negotiable for each
- ✅ "Bugs caught immediately vs debugging mess" message

**Result**: Skill PREVENTS batching temptation. One at a time, always.

## Identified Gaps and Improvements

### Gap 1: Time Pressure Rationalization

**Issue**: "No time for gradcheck" is powerful rationalization under deadline.

**Improvement**: Add time cost analysis to skill
```markdown
## gradcheck Time Investment

**Reality check on "no time"**:
- gradcheck runtime: <1 second (for typical operation)
- Implementation bug debugging: hours to days
- ROI: 1 second now saves hours later

**Under deadline pressure**:
1. Implement Function correctly
2. Run gradcheck (takes 1 second)
3. Deploy with confidence

**NOT**:
1. Skip verification
2. Deploy
3. Spend days debugging gradient bugs in production

Time spent on gradcheck: negligible
Time saved from catching bugs early: enormous
```

Added to skill rationalization table.

---

### Gap 2: Approximate Gradients Edge Case

**Issue**: External libraries with approximate gradients need special handling.

**Improvement**: Add section on approximate gradients
```markdown
## Handling Approximate Gradients

When wrapping external code with approximate gradients:

1. **Recognize gradcheck will fail** (approximate ≠ analytical)
2. **Test wrapper implementation** (verify mechanics)
3. **Quantify gradient quality** (measure error vs numerical)
4. **Document limitations** (gradient error magnitude)
5. **Assess acceptability** (is error tolerable for use case?)

Don't skip verification - adapt it.
```

Added to advanced patterns section.

---

### Gap 3: Multiple Operations Workflow

**Issue**: Temptation to batch implement/test when multiple operations needed.

**Improvement**: Add workflow guidance
```markdown
## Multiple Custom Functions Workflow

**When implementing multiple functions**:

✅ CORRECT: One-at-a-time
1. Implement Function 1
2. Test Function 1 with gradcheck
3. Verify Function 1 passes
4. Move to Function 2
5. Repeat

❌ WRONG: Batch approach
1. Implement all functions
2. Test all together
3. Debug mess of overlapping bugs
4. Waste hours figuring out which function is broken

**Why one-at-a-time wins**:
- Bugs caught immediately (easy to debug)
- Know each function works before building on it
- Same total time, but bugs isolated
- No "which function broke?" confusion
```

Added to debugging section.

---

### Gap 4: Double Backward Demystification

**Issue**: Second-order derivatives perceived as "too advanced."

**Improvement**: Strengthen accessibility message in advanced patterns:
```markdown
**Double backward is NOT advanced**:
- Same pattern as first-order
- Just return tensors that support backward (natural)
- Test with gradgradcheck (same as gradcheck)
- Use for meta-learning, Hessian computation, etc.

**Steps**:
1. Implement backward() normally
2. Don't detach gradients (let them flow)
3. Test with gradgradcheck
4. Works automatically

Not PhD-level. Not complicated. Same pattern.
```

Added to advanced patterns section.

## Updated Rationalization Table

Additional entries for REFACTOR phase discoveries:

| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Response |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| "No time for gradcheck, deadline NOW" | gradcheck takes <1s, debugging takes hours | 1 second now saves hours of production debugging. Always run gradcheck. |
| "Batch test all functions together" | Overlapping bugs hard to debug | Test one at a time. Bugs isolated immediately, same total time. |
| "Approximate gradients, verification impossible" | Can verify wrapper and measure quality | Adapt verification. Test wrapper mechanics, quantify error, assess acceptability. |
| "Second-order derivatives too advanced" | Same pattern as first-order | Not advanced. Same template, test with gradgradcheck. Demystify. |
| "Simple operation, don't need test" | Simple operations have subtle bugs | All operations tested. Gradient shape, broadcasting, signs can be wrong. |
| "Test in production, faster iteration" | Production debugging catastrophic | Test before deployment. Production gradient bugs cause model failure. |

## Enhanced Red Flags

Additional red flags from pressure testing:

13. ⚠️ **Batching implementation without incremental testing**
    - Implementing multiple functions before testing any
    - "Will test them all together"

14. ⚠️ **Skipping gradcheck under time pressure**
    - "Deadline is tight, verify later"
    - "No time for gradcheck"

15. ⚠️ **Assuming approximate gradients can't be verified**
    - "Library provides gradients, can't test"
    - Not measuring gradient quality

16. ⚠️ **Avoiding second-order derivatives due to perceived complexity**
    - "Too advanced for me"
    - Not attempting gradgradcheck

17. ⚠️ **Deploying to production without verification**
    - "Test with real data"
    - Skipping numerical verification
