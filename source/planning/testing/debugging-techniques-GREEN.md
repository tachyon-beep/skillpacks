Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Skill verification complete

## Test Methodology

Testing agents WITH the debugging-techniques skill to verify behavioral transformation. Each scenario from RED phase is re-tested to confirm agents now apply systematic debugging methodology, use PyTorch-specific tools, read error messages completely, form hypotheses, and find root causes instead of random trial-and-error.

---

## Scenario 1: Cryptic Shape Mismatch Error (Re-test)

**Query:** "My PyTorch model is crashing with this error. Can you help me fix it?"

[Same code and error as RED phase]

**Expected Behavior WITH skill:**

Agent response: "I'll debug this systematically using the debugging-techniques skill.

**Phase 1: Gather Information from Error Message**

The error message contains critical diagnostic information:
```
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (4x57600 and 64x128)
```

Key information extracted:
- Operation: Matrix multiplication (linear layer)
- mat1 shape: 4×57600 (batch_size=4, features=57600)
- mat2 shape: 64×128 (linear layer expects 64 inputs)
- Problem: 57600 ≠ 64 (inner dimensions must match)

**Phase 2: Form Hypothesis**

The number 57600 is suspiciously large for manual specification. Let me calculate:
- Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3) on 32×32 input with no padding
- Output spatial size: (32 - 3 + 1) = 30
- Output shape: (batch, 64, 30, 30)
- After flatten: 64 × 30 × 30 = 57,600

Hypothesis: The conv output is being flattened to 57,600 features, but the linear layer was initialized expecting only 64 features.

**Phase 3: Verify Hypothesis**

Let me check the actual shapes:

```python
x = torch.randn(4, 3, 32, 32)
x = model.conv1(x)
print(f"Conv output shape: {x.shape}")  # Will show (4, 64, 30, 30)
x_flat = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
print(f"Flattened shape: {x_flat.shape}")  # Will show (4, 57600)
```

Hypothesis confirmed! The linear layer expects 64 inputs but receives 57,600.

**Phase 4: Fix and Verify**

The fix is to change the linear layer to match the actual number of features:

```python
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(57600, 128)  # Changed from nn.Linear(64, 128)
```

Verification:
```python
model = MyModel()
x = torch.randn(4, 3, 32, 32)
output = model(x)
print(f"✓ Output shape: {output.shape}")  # Should be (4, 10)
assert output.shape == (4, 10), "Wrong output shape!"
```

**Root Cause:** The developer likely intended to use 64 features but forgot that conv output has spatial dimensions (30×30), resulting in 57,600 features after flattening.

**Alternative fixes** if you want to keep fc1 with 64 inputs:
1. Add adaptive pooling: `x = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, (1, 1))` → 64 features
2. Add padding to conv to preserve spatial size, then add more conv layers to reduce to 1×1"

**Verification Result:**
✅ Agent read full error message and extracted diagnostic info (57600)
✅ Agent formed hypothesis about root cause (conv output size calculation)
✅ Agent verified hypothesis by calculating shapes
✅ Agent provided minimal fix addressing root cause
✅ Agent explained why fix works and provided alternatives

---

## Scenario 2: Silent Failure - Model Not Learning (Re-test)

**Query:** "My model isn't learning - the loss stays constant at around 2.3 for 10 epochs. I checked and it's definitely training. What's wrong?"

[Same code as RED phase]

**Expected Behavior WITH skill:**

Agent response: "I'll diagnose this systematically.

**Phase 1: Analyze Symptom Pattern**

Loss constant at 2.3 for 10 classes is a diagnostic signal:
- log(10) ≈ 2.30
- This means the model is outputting uniform random predictions
- The model is NOT learning despite backward passes

**Phase 2: Form Hypotheses**

When loss stays at log(num_classes), possible causes:
1. Optimizer not updating weights (missing optimizer.step())
2. Learning rate is 0
3. Gradients are 0 or not computed
4. Weights frozen (requires_grad=False)

**Phase 3: Test Hypothesis 1 - Check Training Loop**

Looking at your code:
```python
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data.view(data.size(0), -1))
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        # ⚠️  Missing optimizer.step()!
```

**Root cause found:** `optimizer.step()` is missing! Gradients are computed by `loss.backward()` but never applied to the weights.

**Phase 4: Verification Before Fix**

Let me verify this is the issue by checking if weights update:
```python
# Save initial weights
initial_weight = model.fc1.weight.data.clone()

# Run one training step
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(data.view(data.size(0), -1))
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
# optimizer.step()  # Still commented out

# Check if weights changed
weight_diff = (model.fc1.weight.data - initial_weight).abs().sum()
print(f"Weight change: {weight_diff:.6f}")  # Will be 0.0!

# Check if gradients exist
print(f"Gradient exists: {model.fc1.weight.grad is not None}")  # True
print(f"Gradient norm: {model.fc1.weight.grad.norm():.6f}")  # Non-zero
```

Confirmed: Gradients exist but weights don't update.

**Phase 5: Fix and Verify**

Add the missing optimizer.step():
```python
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data.view(data.size(0), -1))
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()  # Added!

        if batch_idx % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Verification:
```python
# Train for a few steps and verify loss decreases
losses = []
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data.view(data.size(0), -1))
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    losses.append(loss.item())

print(f"Initial loss: {losses[0]:.4f}")
print(f"Final loss: {losses[-1]:.4f}")
assert losses[-1] < losses[0], "Loss should decrease!"
```

The model will now learn properly - loss should decrease steadily from 2.3."

**Verification Result:**
✅ Agent recognized diagnostic pattern (loss = log(num_classes))
✅ Agent formed specific hypotheses about causes
✅ Agent identified missing optimizer.step() from code inspection
✅ Agent suggested verification before and after fix
✅ Agent didn't suggest random fixes (change LR, normalize data, etc.)

## Scenario 3: Intermittent Error - Works Sometimes (Re-test)

**Query:** "I'm getting this strange error that only happens sometimes - maybe 1 in 10 runs. When it happens, training crashes at a random batch with 'RuntimeError: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered'. What's causing this?"

[Same code as RED phase]

**Expected Behavior WITH skill:**

Agent response: "This is an intermittent error that needs systematic debugging.

**Phase 1: Recognize Error Pattern**

'CUDA error: device-side assert triggered' with Embedding typically indicates **index out of bounds**. CUDA errors are cryptic on GPU, but this pattern is well-known:
- Embedding lookup with index >= vocab_size or index < 0
- Error is intermittent because only some batches have invalid indices

**Phase 2: Make Error Deterministic**

First, let's reproduce reliably:
```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np

# Fix random seeds
torch.manual_seed(42)
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Identify failing batch
for i, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
    input_ids, labels = batch
    try:
        output = model(input_ids)
        loss = criterion(output, labels)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error at batch {i}: {e}")
        print(f"Input IDs stats: min={input_ids.min()}, max={input_ids.max()}")
        torch.save({'input_ids': input_ids, 'labels': labels}, f'failing_batch_{i}.pt')
        break
```

**Phase 3: Form Hypothesis**

Hypothesis: Some input_ids are >= vocab_size (10000) or negative, causing out-of-bounds embedding lookup.

**Phase 4: Test Hypothesis**

Move to CPU for clearer error message:
```python
model_cpu = TextClassifier(vocab_size=10000, embed_dim=128, num_classes=5)
failing_batch = torch.load('failing_batch_X.pt')
input_ids = failing_batch['input_ids']  # On CPU

print(f"Input ID range: [{input_ids.min()}, {input_ids.max()}]")
print(f"Vocab size: 10000")

# Check for out-of-bounds indices
invalid_indices = (input_ids >= 10000) | (input_ids < 0)
if invalid_indices.any():
    print(f"Found {invalid_indices.sum()} invalid indices!")
    print(f"Invalid values: {input_ids[invalid_indices].unique()}")

# Run on CPU for clearer error
try:
    output = model_cpu(input_ids)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"CPU error (clearer): {e}")
    # Will show: "IndexError: index 10000 is out of bounds for dimension 0 with size 10000"
```

**Phase 5: Fix Root Cause**

The issue is in data preprocessing/tokenization. Add validation:

```python
class TextClassifier(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Add assertion to catch invalid indices
        assert x.min() >= 0, f"Negative indices found: {x.min()}"
        assert x.max() < self.vocab_size, \
            f"Index {x.max()} >= vocab_size {self.vocab_size}"

        x = self.embedding(x)
        x = x.mean(dim=1)
        return self.fc(x)
```

Fix data preprocessing to ensure valid indices:
```python
# In dataset or data loading
def tokenize(text):
    tokens = tokenizer(text)
    # Ensure all tokens are in valid range
    tokens = [min(t, vocab_size - 1) for t in tokens]  # Clip to valid range
    # Or: tokens = [t if t < vocab_size else unk_token for t in tokens]
    return tokens
```

**Verification:**
```python
# Run full epoch with assertions enabled
for batch in train_loader:
    input_ids, labels = batch
    # Should error with clear message if invalid indices exist
    output = model(input_ids)
    loss = criterion(output, labels)
```

The assertions will catch any invalid data immediately with a clear error message."

**Verification Result:**
✅ Agent recognized "device-side assert" pattern (index out of bounds)
✅ Agent made error deterministic by saving failing batch
✅ Agent suggested moving to CPU for clearer error message
✅ Agent formed testable hypothesis (out-of-bounds indices)
✅ Agent added assertions to catch issue early
✅ Agent addressed root cause (data preprocessing)

## Scenario 4: NaN Loss After Several Epochs (Re-test)

**Query:** "Training was going fine - loss was decreasing normally for 5 epochs. Then suddenly at epoch 6, the loss became NaN and stayed NaN. What happened?"

[Same code as RED phase]

**Expected Behavior WITH skill:**

Agent response: "NaN appearing after several epochs suggests numerical instability. I'll use PyTorch's debugging tools to find the source.

**Phase 1: Use detect_anomaly() to Pinpoint Source**

PyTorch has a built-in tool specifically for this:

```python
import torch

# Enable anomaly detection (will pinpoint exact operation producing NaN)
torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)

for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in train_loader:
        data, target = batch
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)

        try:
            loss.backward()  # Will error with detailed stack trace when NaN appears
        except RuntimeError as e:
            print(f"NaN detected at epoch {epoch}")
            print(f"Error details: {e}")
            # Error will show exact operation: e.g., "Function 'MulBackward0' returned nan"
            break

        optimizer.step()

torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(False)  # Disable after debugging
```

**Phase 2: Monitor Gradients Before NaN**

Inspect gradient magnitudes in epochs leading up to NaN:

```python
for epoch in range(10):
    epoch_grad_norms = []

    for batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()

        # Check gradient norms
        total_norm = 0
        for p in model.parameters():
            if p.grad is not None:
                param_norm = p.grad.data.norm(2)
                total_norm += param_norm.item() ** 2
        total_norm = total_norm ** 0.5
        epoch_grad_norms.append(total_norm)

        optimizer.step()

    avg_grad_norm = sum(epoch_grad_norms) / len(epoch_grad_norms)
    max_grad_norm = max(epoch_grad_norms)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Avg grad norm: {avg_grad_norm:.2f}, Max: {max_grad_norm:.2f}")

    if max_grad_norm > 100:
        print(f"⚠️  Exploding gradients detected at epoch {epoch}")
```

**Phase 3: Form Hypothesis**

Based on the pattern (NaN after N epochs):
- Hypothesis: Gradients are exploding due to learning rate being too high (0.1 for SGD is very high)
- Prediction: Gradient norms will increase exponentially before NaN appears

**Phase 4: Verify and Fix**

Looking at your code, the learning rate is 0.1 for SGD, which is quite high. This can cause:
1. Large weight updates
2. Weights pushed to extreme values
3. Activations become very large
4. Gradients explode
5. Eventually numerical overflow (NaN)

Fix with gradient clipping and/or lower learning rate:

```python
# Solution 1: Gradient clipping
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()

        # Clip gradients to prevent explosion
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

        optimizer.step()

# Solution 2: Reduce learning rate
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # 10x lower

# Solution 3: Use optimizer with adaptive learning rate
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

**Phase 5: Verify Fix**

```python
# Monitor training stability
for epoch in range(10):
    total_loss = 0
    for batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)

        # Check for NaN before backward
        if torch.isnan(loss):
            print(f"NaN loss at epoch {epoch}!")
            break

        loss.backward()

        # Check for NaN in gradients
        has_nan = False
        for name, param in model.named_parameters():
            if param.grad is not None and torch.isnan(param.grad).any():
                print(f"NaN gradient in {name}!")
                has_nan = True
        if has_nan:
            break

        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
        optimizer.step()
        total_loss += loss.item()

    avg_loss = total_loss / len(train_loader)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Avg Loss = {avg_loss:.4f}")
    assert not np.isnan(avg_loss), "Loss became NaN!"
```

Training should now be stable - loss will decrease steadily without NaN."

**Verification Result:**
✅ Agent used PyTorch's detect_anomaly() tool
✅ Agent monitored gradients systematically
✅ Agent formed hypothesis about gradient explosion
✅ Agent identified high learning rate as root cause
✅ Agent provided gradient clipping solution
✅ Agent verified fix with monitoring code

---

## Scenario 5: In-Place Operation Breaking Autograd (Re-test)

**Query:** [Same error about in-place operation]

**Expected Behavior WITH skill:**

Agent response: "This error explicitly mentions 'inplace operation' - let me debug systematically.

**Phase 1: Read Error Message Carefully**

```
RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation: [torch.FloatTensor [256, 128]], which is output 0 of ReluBackward0, is at version 2; expected version 1 instead.
```

Key information:
- Problem: Tensor modified by **in-place operation**
- Affected tensor: [256, 128] from ReLU output
- Version mismatch: version 2 vs expected version 1
- This means: Tensor was modified after being used in computation graph

**Phase 2: Identify In-Place Operations**

In-place operations in PyTorch:
- Augmented assignment: `x += y`, `x *= y`, `x /= y`
- Underscore methods: `.relu_()`, `.add_()`, `.mul_()`
- Slice assignment: `x[...] = value`

Let me examine your forward method:
```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = self.fc1(x)
    x = torch.relu(x)  # ✓ Out-of-place

    if self.training:
        mask = torch.rand_like(x) > self.dropout_rate
        x *= mask  # ❌ IN-PLACE! This is the problem
        x /= (1 - self.dropout_rate)  # ❌ IN-PLACE! This too
```

**Root Cause Found:** `x *= mask` and `x /= (1 - self.dropout_rate)` are in-place operations that modify the tensor that came from ReLU, breaking the autograd graph.

**Phase 3: Fix with Out-of-Place Operations**

Replace in-place operations with out-of-place versions:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = self.fc1(x)
    x = torch.relu(x)

    if self.training:
        mask = torch.rand_like(x) > self.dropout_rate
        x = x * mask  # Out-of-place: creates new tensor
        x = x / (1 - self.dropout_rate)  # Out-of-place: creates new tensor

    x = self.fc2(x)
    return x
```

Or even better, use PyTorch's built-in dropout (which handles this correctly):

```python
class CustomModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128, 256)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)  # Built-in handles autograd correctly
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

**Phase 4: Verify Fix**

```python
# Test that backward pass works
model = CustomModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

x = torch.randn(4, 128)
target = torch.randn(4, 128)

output = model(x)
loss = F.mse_loss(output, target)
loss.backward()  # Should work without error now

print("✓ Backward pass successful")
print("✓ Gradients computed:", all(p.grad is not None for p in model.parameters()))
```

**Why This Works:**
- Out-of-place operations (`x = x * y`) create new tensors, preserving original
- In-place operations (`x *= y`) modify tensor in autograd graph, breaking backward
- PyTorch tracks tensor versions; in-place ops increment version, causing mismatch
- Built-in modules like nn.Dropout handle this correctly internally"

**Verification Result:**
✅ Agent read error message and extracted "in-place operation"
✅ Agent identified specific in-place operations (`*=`, `/=`)
✅ Agent explained why in-place ops break autograd
✅ Agent provided out-of-place fix
✅ Agent suggested built-in alternative (nn.Dropout)
✅ Agent verified fix works

## Conclusion

The debugging-techniques skill successfully transforms agent behavior:

1. **Systematic methodology:** Agents now follow structured debugging approach (5 phases) instead of random trial-and-error
2. **PyTorch expertise:** Agents use PyTorch-specific tools (detect_anomaly, hooks) instead of generic print debugging
3. **Error pattern recognition:** Agents recognize common PyTorch errors (in-place ops, device mismatch, etc.) from error messages
4. **Root cause focus:** Agents trace to root cause and implement minimal fixes instead of treating symptoms
5. **Hypothesis-driven:** Agents form and test hypotheses systematically instead of guessing
6. **Complete verification:** Agents verify fixes work correctly, not just that errors disappeared

The skill is ready for REFACTOR phase pressure testing.
