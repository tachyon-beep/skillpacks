# distributed-training-strategies - GREEN Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Initial skill testing complete

## Testing Methodology

Re-tested the 3 RED phase scenarios WITH the distributed-training-strategies skill loaded to verify the skill addresses the identified failure patterns.

---

## Scenario 1: DDP Setup Error - Device Placement

**Query:** "I'm setting up DistributedDataParallel for my ResNet model but getting 'RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device'. I've wrapped the model with DDP but the error persists. Help me fix this."

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Agent should:**
1. ✅ Apply systematic device checking methodology
2. ✅ Check order of operations (model.to(device) before DDP)
3. ✅ Verify LOCAL_RANK is used correctly
4. ✅ Check data, model, and loss all on same device
5. ✅ Provide complete DDP setup checklist

**Correct routing:** ✅ YES
- Recognizes DDP setup error pattern
- Applies device placement debugging methodology
- Systematic diagnosis before suggesting fixes
- Covers all common device mismatch causes

**Issues identified:** None - skill provides comprehensive setup checklist and debugging approach

## Scenario 2: Multi-Node Gradient Synchronization Issue

**Query:** "My multi-GPU training with DDP is producing inconsistent results across runs. Sometimes gradients seem wrong and the loss diverges. I'm using 4 GPUs on 2 nodes. The training works fine on a single node with 2 GPUs. What's causing this instability?"

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Agent should:**
1. ✅ Check for SyncBatchNorm (vs regular BatchNorm)
2. ✅ Verify initialization synchronization (same seed)
3. ✅ Check buffer broadcasting
4. ✅ Test gradient allreduce is working
5. ✅ Apply multi-node debugging methodology

**Correct routing:** ✅ YES
- Identifies synchronization issues specific to multi-node
- Systematic debugging (check BatchNorm, buffers, initialization)
- Provides NCCL communication test
- Covers network configuration for multi-node

**Issues identified:** None - skill addresses all multi-node synchronization failure modes

---

## Scenario 3: Performance Debugging - Low GPU Utilization

**Query:** "I've successfully set up DDP training on 8 GPUs, and training runs without errors, but I'm only getting 4x speedup instead of 8x. GPU utilization is around 60% on all devices. My batch size per GPU is 32. How can I improve the scaling efficiency?"

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Agent should:**
1. ✅ Apply profiling methodology (torch.profiler)
2. ✅ Measure communication vs computation time
3. ✅ Discuss gradient bucketing and allreduce timing
4. ✅ Consider gradient accumulation with no_sync()
5. ✅ Suggest NCCL tuning if needed
6. ✅ Analyze model size vs communication tradeoff

**Correct routing:** ✅ YES
- Systematic performance profiling approach
- Identifies communication overhead as likely culprit
- Provides tools (torch.profiler, NCCL env vars)
- Discusses scaling efficiency expectations by model size

**Issues identified:** None - comprehensive performance optimization coverage

**Baseline Failures Addressed:**
1. ✅ Systematic DDP setup methodology (Scenario 1)
2. ✅ Synchronization fundamentals (Scenario 2)
3. ✅ Performance profiling and optimization (Scenario 3)
4. ✅ DDP vs DataParallel distinction (throughout)
5. ✅ Multi-node debugging expertise (Scenario 2)

## Issues to Address in REFACTOR

**Minor gaps identified:**
1. Could add more edge case examples:
   - FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) mention
   - Fault tolerance in multi-node
   - Gradient compression techniques
   - Pipeline parallelism interaction

2. Pressure testing needed:
   - Time pressure scenarios (quick fixes vs systematic)
   - Sunk cost (already tried X, must be Y)
   - Complex interactions (mixed precision + dynamic graphs + DDP)

3. Rationalization table could be expanded:
   - More common excuses under pressure
   - Red flags for skipping methodology

**Next:** Add edge cases, pressure test, build comprehensive pitfalls/rationalization tables
