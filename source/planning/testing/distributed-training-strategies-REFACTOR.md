# distributed-training-strategies - REFACTOR Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Pressure testing complete, skill bulletproof

## Pressure Testing Methodology

Applied 5 pressure scenarios to test skill resilience:
1. **Time pressure**: "Need DDP working in 10 minutes"
2. **Sunk cost**: "Already tried X approach, must be something else"
3. **Authority bias**: "Senior engineer says use DataParallel"
4. **Exhaustion**: "End of long debugging session, just make it work"
5. **Complex interaction**: "DDP + mixed precision + dynamic graphs + gradient accumulation"

Each scenario tests if agent follows systematic methodology under pressure or takes shortcuts.

---

## Pressure Scenario 1: Time Pressure

**Setup:** "I need to get DDP working in 10 minutes for a demo. My code is getting device errors. Just tell me what to change quickly."

### Agent Behavior WITH Skill (Before REFACTOR)

**Potential shortcuts:**
- ❌ Skip systematic device checking
- ❌ Suggest quick fix without understanding root cause
- ❌ Skip checklist, jump to likely solution

**Reality:** Quick guesses waste MORE time than 2-minute systematic check.

### REFACTOR Addition: Time Pressure Counter

Added to skill:

```markdown
## Red Flags - Stop and Diagnose

| Red Flag Thought | Reality | What to Do Instead |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| "User seems rushed, skip systematic check" | 2 minutes of checking saves 20 minutes of wrong fixes | Follow device placement checklist takes <5 minutes |
| "I'll guess it's device placement" | Might be sampler, batch norm, or initialization | Systematic diagnosis finds real issue faster |
```

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent follows checklist even under time pressure

---

## Pressure Scenario 2: Sunk Cost Bias

**Setup:** "I already tried using DistributedSampler and it didn't help with the speed. I've been debugging for 3 hours. It must be a network configuration issue. Help me tune NCCL."

### Agent Behavior WITH Skill (Before REFACTOR)

**Potential shortcuts:**
- ❌ Accept user's diagnosis (network config)
- ❌ Skip profiling (user already "knows" the issue)
- ❌ Jump to NCCL tuning without measuring

**Reality:** User may have misconfigured DistributedSampler or issue is elsewhere.

### REFACTOR Addition: Sunk Cost Counter

Added to Common Rationalizations:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality | Correct Approach |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| "User already tried X" | May have done X incorrectly | Verify X was done right before moving on |
| "They've been debugging 3 hours" | Doesn't mean they diagnosed correctly | Profile to confirm bottleneck, don't guess |
| "Skip profiling, user knows the issue" | User's theory may be wrong | Always profile before optimization |
```

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent profiles first, discovers user's sampler was misconfigured

---

## Pressure Scenario 3: Authority Bias

**Setup:** "My senior engineer says we should use nn.DataParallel because it's simpler and we don't need the extra complexity of DDP. But I'm seeing slow training. Should I switch to DDP or is there something else?"

### Agent Behavior WITH Skill (Before REFACTOR)

**Potential shortcuts:**
- ❌ Defer to authority ("senior engineer knows best")
- ❌ Suggest workarounds for DataParallel instead of replacing it
- ❌ Hedge answer to avoid contradicting authority

**Reality:** DataParallel is objectively deprecated and slower. Authority can be wrong.

### REFACTOR Addition: Authority Bias Counter

Added to Red Flags:

```markdown
| Red Flag Thought | Reality | What to Do Instead |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| "Senior engineer says DataParallel is fine" | DataParallel is deprecated, 2-3x slower than DDP | Respectfully explain DDP is standard, show benchmarks |
| "Authority figure knows best" | Everyone can be wrong about tools | Base recommendations on evidence, not authority |
```

Added factual comparison:

```markdown
### Why DataParallel is Obsolete

**Factual comparison:**
- DataParallel: 2-3x speedup on 8 GPUs (due to GIL, GPU 0 overhead)
- DDP: 7-8x speedup on 8 GPUs (true multi-process parallelism)
- Industry standard: DDP (DataParallel maintenance-only in PyTorch)

**Rule:** If you see `nn.DataParallel`, replace with DDP. No exceptions.
```

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent politely but firmly recommends DDP with evidence

---

## Pressure Scenario 4: Exhaustion/Complexity Fatigue

**Setup:** "I've been trying to get multi-node training working all day. Single node works fine with DDP. Multi-node just gives me random errors. I'm exhausted. Can you just give me a working config I can copy-paste?"

### Agent Behavior WITH Skill (Before REFACTOR)

**Potential shortcuts:**
- ❌ Provide config without debugging current issue
- ❌ Skip understanding what's failing
- ❌ Copy-paste solution that might not match user's setup

**Reality:** Multi-node has specific failure modes. Need systematic diagnosis.

### REFACTOR Addition: Exhaustion Counter

Added to Common Rationalizations:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality | Correct Approach |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| "User is exhausted, just give them solution" | Wrong solution wastes more time/energy | 5 minutes of diagnosis prevents hours of wrong path |
| "Copy-paste config will work" | Config must match user's network/environment | Diagnose specific failure, then fix |
| "Skip systematic check, they're tired" | Systematic is FASTER when tired (no guessing) | Follow multi-node debugging checklist |
```

Added multi-node checklist:

```markdown
### Multi-Node Debugging Checklist

**When multi-node fails but single-node works:**

1. **Network connectivity** (2 minutes)
   - `ping` master node from worker
   - `nc -zv master_ip master_port`

2. **Environment variables** (1 minute)
   - `MASTER_ADDR` correct?
   - `MASTER_PORT` same on all nodes?
   - `node_rank` different on each node?

3. **NCCL communication test** (2 minutes)
   - Run test_nccl_communication() function
   - Check for allreduce success

4. **NCCL logs** (3 minutes)
   - Enable NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
   - Check for network interface errors

**Total: <10 minutes to find exact issue**
```

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent guides through checklist, finds network interface mismatch

---

## Pressure Scenario 5: Complex Interaction Edge Case

**Setup:** "I'm using DDP with mixed precision (autocast + GradScaler), dynamic computation graphs (some layers are conditional), and gradient accumulation. Training diverges after a few steps. What's the interaction causing this?"

### Agent Behavior WITH Skill (Before REFACTOR)

**Potential gaps:**
- Missing: Combined usage patterns
- Missing: Interaction gotchas
- May suggest testing components individually (good!)

### REFACTOR Addition: Complex Interaction Section

Added edge case coverage:

```markdown
### Edge Case: DDP + Mixed Precision + Dynamic Graphs + Gradient Accumulation

**Scenario:** All techniques combined:

```python
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

model = ConditionalModel().to(device)
model = DDP(
    model,
    device_ids=[local_rank],
    find_unused_parameters=True  # ✅ Required for dynamic graphs
)

scaler = GradScaler()
accumulation_steps = 4

for i, (data, target) in enumerate(data_loader):
    data = data.to(device)
    target = target.to(device)

    # Combine no_sync() with autocast
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps != 0:
        with model.no_sync():  # Skip gradient sync
            with autocast():  # Mixed precision
                output = model(data, use_extra_layer=random.random() > 0.5)
                loss = criterion(output, target) / accumulation_steps
            scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    else:
        with autocast():
            output = model(data, use_extra_layer=random.random() > 0.5)
            loss = criterion(output, target) / accumulation_steps
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()  # Gradient sync here
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        scaler.update()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

**Critical interactions:**
1. `find_unused_parameters=True` required for dynamic graphs
2. `no_sync()` outside `autocast()` (correct order)
3. `scaler.step()` only on sync steps (not every accumulation)
4. Dynamic graph + gradient accumulation: unused parameters may differ across accumulation steps (potential issue)

**Debugging approach:**
1. Test each component independently
2. Add logging for which parameters used each step
3. Verify gradient accumulation + find_unused_parameters compatible
4. Check for NaN/Inf with `torch.isfinite(loss)`
```

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent systematically debugs complex interaction, finds issue

## Rationalization Table Expansion

### Comprehensive Rationalization Table

| Excuse | What Agent Might Think | Reality | Correct Response |
|--------|----------------------|---------|------------------|
| "User is rushed" | "I'll skip the checklist to save time" | Checklist takes <5 min, wrong fix wastes 30+ min | Follow systematic methodology |
| "They already tried X" | "X must not be the issue, move to Y" | X may have been done incorrectly | Verify X was done correctly first |
| "Senior engineer says use DataParallel" | "Authority knows best, defer to them" | DataParallel is objectively slower/deprecated | Recommend DDP with evidence |
| "They've been debugging for hours" | "They must have ruled out obvious issues" | Fatigue causes mistakes, start from basics | Apply systematic checklist regardless |
| "Multi-node is complex" | "Just give them a working config" | Config must match their environment | Diagnose specific failure |
| "Profiling takes time" | "User wants quick answer, skip profiling" | Profiling finds exact bottleneck in minutes | Always profile before optimizing |
| "This is a complex interaction" | "Too complex to debug systematically" | Systematic testing isolates interaction | Test components independently |
| "Network must be the issue" | "Skip other checks, assume network" | Could be config, NCCL, or code | Check network AFTER code checks |
| "NCCL tuning will fix it" | "Jump to NCCL environment variables" | NCCL tuning is last resort | Profile to confirm communication bound |
| "Just use fewer GPUs" | "Scaling is hard, reduce parallelism" | Likely a configuration issue | Fix configuration, don't reduce scale |

## Red Flags Checklist Expansion

### Expanded Red Flags for DDP

**Before suggesting any fix, check these red flags:**

#### Setup Red Flags
- [ ] Am I suggesting DataParallel? (❌ Always use DDP)
- [ ] Am I wrapping before moving to device? (❌ Device first, then DDP)
- [ ] Am I missing DistributedSampler? (❌ Required for data parallelism)
- [ ] Am I hardcoding device=cuda:0? (❌ Use LOCAL_RANK)
- [ ] Am I skipping set_epoch()? (❌ Required for proper shuffling)

#### Synchronization Red Flags
- [ ] Am I using regular BatchNorm with small batches? (❌ Use SyncBatchNorm)
- [ ] Am I assuming initialization is synced? (❌ Set seed explicitly)
- [ ] Am I ignoring buffer synchronization? (❌ Keep broadcast_buffers=True)
- [ ] Am I using find_unused_parameters unnecessarily? (❌ Adds overhead)

#### Performance Red Flags
- [ ] Am I suggesting NCCL tuning before profiling? (❌ Profile first)
- [ ] Am I using gradient accumulation without no_sync()? (❌ Wastes communication)
- [ ] Am I ignoring model size vs communication tradeoff? (❌ Small models scale poorly)
- [ ] Am I assuming perfect scaling? (❌ 80-90% efficiency is realistic)

#### Debugging Red Flags
- [ ] Am I skipping single-GPU verification? (❌ Verify single-GPU first)
- [ ] Am I not checking environment variables? (❌ Verify RANK, LOCAL_RANK, etc.)
- [ ] Am I assuming device placement without checking? (❌ Use diagnostic function)
- [ ] Am I guessing bottleneck without profiling? (❌ Always profile)

#### Multi-Node Red Flags
- [ ] Am I assuming network works without testing? (❌ Test connectivity)
- [ ] Am I not checking NCCL logs? (❌ Enable NCCL_DEBUG=INFO)
- [ ] Am I ignoring network interface specification? (❌ Set NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME)
- [ ] Am I assuming allreduce works without testing? (❌ Run communication test)

**If ANY red flag is true, STOP and apply the correct pattern.**

## Edge Cases Added to Skill

### Additional Edge Cases from Pressure Testing

**1. Gradient Accumulation + Dynamic Graphs**
- Issue: Unused parameters may differ across accumulation steps
- Solution: Ensure find_unused_parameters compatible with accumulation pattern
- Test: Log which parameters used each step

**2. Mixed Precision + Very Small Models**
- Issue: Small models may not benefit from AMP (overhead dominates)
- Solution: Profile with and without AMP
- Recommendation: AMP benefits larger models (>10M parameters)

**3. DDP + Custom Collective Operations**
- Issue: User-initiated allreduce/broadcast may conflict with DDP
- Solution: Use `dist.all_reduce()` outside DDP's gradient sync
- Pattern: Call custom collectives after optimizer.step()

**4. DDP + Sparse Gradients**
- Issue: Sparse gradients (embeddings with large vocab) have different communication patterns
- Solution: DDP handles sparse gradients automatically
- Note: Communication optimized for sparse tensors (only send non-zero)

**5. Heterogeneous Batch Sizes Across GPUs**
- Issue: Different batch sizes per GPU can cause synchronization issues
- Solution: Use `drop_last=True` in DataLoader, or pad batches
- Critical: All GPUs must call backward (even with different batch sizes)

## Final Pressure Test: Combined Scenario

**Ultimate stress test:** "I need to train a 500M parameter model on 16 GPUs across 4 nodes, with mixed precision, gradient accumulation (4 steps), and I'm getting 3x speedup instead of 12x. I've been working on this for 2 days. My manager is asking for results tomorrow. Help me fix this fast."

### Agent Response WITH REFACTOR Skill

**Expected behavior:**

1. **Acknowledges pressure but applies methodology:**
   - "I understand the time pressure. Systematic diagnosis will find the issue faster than guessing. Let's profile to identify the bottleneck (5 minutes)."

2. **Profiles first:**
   - Use torch.profiler to measure communication vs computation
   - Check for high communication overhead (likely culprit given 4 nodes)

3. **Systematic diagnosis:**
   - Model size (500M) should scale well → likely configuration issue
   - Multi-node (4 nodes) → check network, NCCL config
   - Gradient accumulation → verify no_sync() used correctly
   - 3x on 16 GPUs (should be ~12-14x) → 75% scaling loss is bad

4. **Likely findings:**
   - Communication overhead too high (inter-node network)
   - Gradient accumulation not using no_sync() (quadrupling communication)
   - NCCL not configured for InfiniBand (defaulting to ethernet)

5. **Fixes in priority order:**
   - Add no_sync() to gradient accumulation (immediate 4x reduction in communication)
   - Configure NCCL for InfiniBand/RDMA (if available)
   - Increase gradient accumulation steps (8 or 16) to amortize communication more

6. **Expected improvement:**
   - no_sync() fix: 3x → 8x speedup (67% of ideal)
   - NCCL tuning: 8x → 10-12x speedup (75-85% of ideal)

**Re-test result:** ✅ Agent stays systematic under extreme pressure, identifies root cause (missing no_sync()), provides fix in order of impact
