# REFACTOR Phase: Learning Rate Scheduling Pressure Testing

## Purpose

Pressure test the learning-rate-scheduling skill with edge cases, conflicting scenarios, and attempts to rationalize away best practices. Identify any gaps or loopholes that need to be closed.

## Test Date

2025-10-30

---

## Edge Case 1: "What's the Best Scheduler?"

### Scenario (Lacks Context)

```
User: "What's the best learning rate scheduler?"
```

### Pressure Point

Generic question without context. Agent might give generic answer or pick favorites without understanding user's needs.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Push back: "Depends on your model, training duration, and compute budget"
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions:
  - What model type? (CNN, transformer, etc.)
  - How many epochs?
  - Do you know optimal schedule or exploring?
  - What's your compute budget?
- ✅ Provide decision flowchart from Section 6
- ✅ Give conditional recommendations:
  - "If transformer: Cosine + warmup"
  - "If fast training: OneCycleLR"
  - "If unknown: ReduceLROnPlateau or Cosine"

### Skill Coverage

Section 6 - Scheduler Selection Guide:
- Flowchart with decision tree - ✅
- "What's your training duration?" - ✅ Prompts for context
- "What's your model type?" - ✅
- Domain-specific recommendations - ✅

Section 12 - Quick Reference:
- "Q: What should I use for..." - ✅ Context-based answers

**Assessment:** PASS - Skill provides decision framework requiring context

---

## Edge Case 2: OneCycle Still Unstable After Lowering max_lr

### Scenario (Multiple Attempts Failed)

```
User: "I tried OneCycleLR with max_lr=0.1, training unstable.
I lowered to max_lr=0.03, still unstable around epoch 5.
I lowered to max_lr=0.01, still seeing loss spikes.
What's wrong? Should I just give up on OneCycle?"
```

### Pressure Point

User tried recommended solutions but still failing. Need to diagnose deeper issues beyond just max_lr.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Don't give up on OneCycle yet - debug further
- ✅ Check step() placement: "Are you calling scheduler.step() every batch?"
- ✅ Check batch size: "Large batches may need warmup even with OneCycle"
- ✅ Check gradient clipping: "Add gradient clipping for stability"
- ✅ Verify OneCycle parameters:
  - pct_start (should be 0.2-0.4)
  - div_factor (initial LR calculation)
  - final_div_factor (final LR)
- ✅ Alternative: "OneCycle may not be right for your problem - try Cosine instead"
- ✅ Ask about model/data: "What model and dataset? Some models inherently unstable"

### Skill Coverage

Section 3 - OneCycleLR:
- Common Mistakes section mentions step() placement - ✅
- But doesn't cover pct_start or div_factor tuning - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

Section 9 - Debugging OneCycleLR:
- Covers max_lr tuning - ✅
- Mentions step() placement - ✅
- Suggests plotting LR schedule - ✅
- But doesn't cover pct_start/div_factor tuning - ⚠️ MINOR GAP
- Doesn't suggest gradient clipping - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

**Assessment:** PARTIAL PASS - Covers main issues but missing some advanced OneCycle parameters

### REFACTOR Action

Add to Section 3 - OneCycleLR:

```markdown
## Advanced OneCycleLR Tuning

If lowering max_lr doesn't resolve instability:

1. **Adjust pct_start (warmup fraction):**
   - Default: 0.3 (30% warmup, 70% cooldown)
   - If unstable at peak: Increase to 0.4 or 0.5 (longer warmup)
   - If unstable in cooldown: Decrease to 0.2 (shorter warmup, gentler descent)

2. **Adjust div_factor (initial LR):**
   - Default: 25 (initial_lr = max_lr / 25)
   - If unstable at start: Increase to 50 or 100 (start even lower)

3. **Adjust final_div_factor (final LR):**
   - Default: 10000 (final_lr = max_lr / 10000)
   - If unstable at end: Decrease to 1000 (end at higher LR)

4. **Add gradient clipping:**
   ```python
   torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
   ```

5. **Consider OneCycle may not be right for your problem:**
   - Very deep networks may be too unstable for OneCycle
   - Large models may need gentler schedule (Cosine)
   - Alternative: Use Cosine + warmup for more stable training
```

---

## Edge Case 3: Transformer Training Without Warmup "Working Fine"

### Scenario (Anecdotal Evidence)

```
User: "You say warmup is mandatory for transformers, but I trained a small ViT
without warmup and it worked fine. Got 85% accuracy. Why do I need warmup?"
```

### Pressure Point

User has counter-example that "worked." Need to show what they're leaving on the table.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Acknowledge it can "work" but suboptimal
- ✅ Explain: "You got 85% but likely could get 87-88% with warmup"
- ✅ Ask: "Did you compare with warmup? Run ablation study"
- ✅ Explain: "Small ViT may be more stable, but still benefits from warmup"
- ✅ Note: "Training stability improves (fewer failed runs)"
- ✅ Cite: "All published ViT papers use warmup - it's standard practice"
- ✅ Suggest: "Try same setup with warmup, compare final accuracy"

### Skill Coverage

Section 4 - Warmup:
- "ALWAYS use warmup when: Training transformers" - ✅ Strong statement
- "Transformers REQUIRE warmup - not optional" - ✅
- But doesn't address "it worked for me" counter - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

Section 10 - Rationalization Table:
- "Warmup seems optional" → "MANDATORY for transformers" - ✅
- But doesn't quantify performance loss - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

**Assessment:** PARTIAL PASS - Strong stance but doesn't address anecdotal counter-examples

### REFACTOR Action

Add to Section 4 - Warmup:

```markdown
## "But My Transformer Trained Fine Without Warmup"

Some users report training transformers without warmup successfully. Here's the reality:

**What "fine" actually means:**
- Training didn't diverge (NaN) - that's a low bar
- Got reasonable accuracy - but NOT optimal accuracy

**What you're missing:**

1. **Performance gap (1-3% accuracy):**
   - Without warmup: Training works, achieves 85% accuracy
   - With warmup: Same model achieves 87-88% accuracy
   - That 2-3% is SIGNIFICANT for competitive models

2. **Training stability:**
   - Without warmup: Some runs diverge, need to restart with lower LR
   - With warmup: Stable training, consistent results

3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:**
   - Without warmup: Very sensitive to initial LR choice
   - With warmup: More forgiving, wider stable LR range

**Empirical Evidence:**

Check published papers:
- ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020): Uses warmup
- DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021): Uses warmup
- Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021): Uses warmup
- BERT (Devlin et al., 2018): Uses warmup
- GPT-2/3 (Radford et al.): Uses warmup

**Every competitive transformer model uses warmup - there's a reason.**

**Recommendation:**
- Run ablation: Train your model with and without warmup
- Compare: Final test accuracy, training stability, number of failed runs
- Warmup is one line of code for 1-3% better performance - excellent ROI
```

## Edge Case 4: Conflicting Paper vs Modern Practice

### Scenario (Following Old Paper)

```
User: "I'm following the ResNet paper from 2015. It uses StepLR dropping at
epochs 30, 60, 90 with no warmup. But modern guides recommend CosineAnnealing
with warmup. Which should I use? I want to reproduce the paper's results."
```

### Pressure Point

Conflict between reproduction (paper's exact recipe) and modern best practices.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Clarify goal: "Are you reproducing paper or getting best performance?"
- ✅ For reproduction: "Use exact paper recipe (StepLR, no warmup)"
- ✅ For best performance: "Use modern recipe (Cosine + warmup)"
- ✅ Explain evolution: "CosineAnnealing emerged as better practice post-2015"
- ✅ Quantify: "Modern recipe typically +0.5-1% better than paper's recipe"
- ✅ Note: "Paper's recipe will work, just not cutting-edge anymore"
- ✅ Suggest: "Start with paper's recipe, then try modern as improvement"

### Skill Coverage

Section 6 - Scheduler Selection:
- "Following paper recipe?" → "Use paper's exact schedule" - ✅ Addresses this
- But doesn't explain paper vs modern tradeoff - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

Section 8 - Modern Best Practices:
- Shows modern recipes - ✅
- But doesn't discuss when to use old vs new - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

**Assessment:** PARTIAL PASS - Acknowledges both paths but doesn't explain tradeoff clearly

### REFACTOR Action

Add to Section 6 - Scheduler Selection Guide:

```markdown
## Paper Recipe vs Modern Best Practices

**If goal is EXACT REPRODUCTION:**
- Use paper's exact schedule (down to every detail)
- Example: ResNet paper (2015) uses MultiStepLR [30, 60, 90], no warmup
- Rationale: Reproduce results, ensure apples-to-apples comparison

**If goal is BEST PERFORMANCE:**
- Use modern recipe (e.g., Cosine + warmup)
- Typically +0.5-2% better than original paper
- Benefit from 5-10 years of community learning

**Evolution of Practices:**

Early papers (2012-2016):
- StepLR with manual milestones
- No warmup
- SGD with momentum
- Example: ResNet, VGG, AlexNet

Modern papers (2018-2025):
- CosineAnnealingLR or OneCycleLR
- Warmup standard (especially transformers)
- AdamW increasingly common
- Example: ViT, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt

**Recommendation:**

1. **Start with paper recipe** (establishes baseline)
2. **Validate reproduction** (should match paper's reported accuracy)
3. **Try modern recipe** (Cosine + warmup)
4. **Compare results** (modern usually better)

**Trade-off:**
- Paper recipe: Reproducible, comparable to paper
- Modern recipe: Better performance, cutting-edge practice

Both are valid depending on your goal.
```

## Edge Case 5: Multiple Compounding Issues

### Scenario (Everything Wrong at Once)

```
User: "Training is a disaster. Using ViT-B/16, batch size 2048, AdamW lr=0.01,
no scheduler, training for 50 epochs. Loss goes to NaN by epoch 3. I also
increased weight decay to 0.5 to prevent overfitting. What's wrong?"
```

### Pressure Point

Multiple critical issues at once:
1. No warmup (mandatory for ViT)
2. Very large batch size (needs warmup)
3. Very high LR (0.01 too high for AdamW)
4. No scheduler
5. Weight decay too high (0.5 insane)

Agent needs to prioritize and diagnose systematically.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Identify CRITICAL issue first: "Loss → NaN means divergence"
- ✅ Prioritize root causes:
  1. CRITICAL: No warmup for ViT + large batch → NaN
  2. CRITICAL: LR 0.01 way too high for AdamW (should be 1e-3)
  3. CRITICAL: Weight decay 0.5 is crazy (should be 0.05)
  4. IMPORTANT: No scheduler for 50-epoch training
- ✅ Provide fix in order:
  1. Lower LR to 1e-3
  2. Add 5-10 epoch warmup
  3. Fix weight decay to 0.05
  4. Add CosineAnnealing
- ✅ Explain: "Multiple issues compounding - fix all for stable training"

### Skill Coverage

Section 4 - Warmup:
- "ALWAYS use warmup when: Large batch sizes (>512)" - ✅
- "Training transformers" - ✅

Section 8 - Vision Transformers Recipe:
- Shows correct settings (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=0.05) - ✅

Section 9 - Debugging:
- "Issue: Training Unstable / Loss Spikes" - ✅
- Mentions no warmup, high LR - ✅

Section 11 - Red Flags:
- 🚨 Training transformer without warmup - ✅
- 🚨 Loss NaN in first few epochs - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS - Skill provides debugging framework to identify multiple issues

---

## Edge Case 6: "Just Tell Me What To Use"

### Scenario (Wants Cookbook, No Thinking)

```
User: "I don't want to think about this. Just tell me what scheduler to use
for any model. What's the universal default?"
```

### Pressure Point

User wants one-size-fits-all answer, but optimal schedule is context-dependent.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Acknowledge desire for simple default
- ✅ Provide pragmatic default: "CosineAnnealingLR with T_max=total_epochs"
- ✅ Explain: "Works well for 80% of cases, no tuning needed"
- ✅ Add warmup caveat: "If transformer or large batch, add 5-epoch warmup"
- ✅ But note: "Won't be optimal for all cases (OneCycle better for fast training)"
- ✅ Encourage: "This gets you 90%, context-specific tuning gets last 10%"

### Skill Coverage

Section 3 - CosineAnnealingLR:
- "Modern Default" - ✅ Positioned as go-to
- "Widely used, no tuning" - ✅

Section 12 - Quick Reference:
- "Don't know optimal schedule? → ReduceLROnPlateau or CosineAnnealing" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS - Skill provides pragmatic default while noting limitations

---

## Edge Case 7: ReduceLROnPlateau Never Reducing

### Scenario (Scheduler Not Working)

```
User: "I'm using ReduceLROnPlateau but it never reduces the learning rate,
even though validation loss stopped improving 20 epochs ago. patience=10,
factor=0.1. What's wrong?"
```

### Pressure Point

Scheduler not behaving as expected. Could be several issues:
- Threshold too strict
- Mode wrong (min vs max)
- Metric not actually plateaued (still tiny improvements)
- Not passing metric correctly

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Verify metric passing: "Show code - are you passing val_loss to step()?"
- ✅ Check mode: "mode='min' for loss, 'max' for accuracy - is it correct?"
- ✅ Check threshold: "threshold=1e-4 means improvement <0.01% ignored"
- ✅ Debug: "Print val_loss each epoch - is it truly plateaued?"
- ✅ Suggest: "Lower threshold to 1e-5 or 0 to be more sensitive"
- ✅ Suggest: "Print when scheduler reduces: verbose=True"

### Skill Coverage

Section 3 - ReduceLROnPlateau:
- Shows correct usage: scheduler.step(val_loss) - ✅
- Explains parameters (mode, factor, patience, threshold) - ✅
- But doesn't debug "not reducing" scenario - ⚠️ MINOR GAP

Section 7 - Pitfall 4:
- "Not Passing Metric to ReduceLROnPlateau" - ✅ Covers one cause

**Assessment:** PARTIAL PASS - Covers correct usage but light on debugging

### REFACTOR Action

Add to Section 9 - Debugging:

```markdown
## Issue: ReduceLROnPlateau Never Reduces LR

**Symptoms:**
- Using ReduceLROnPlateau for 50+ epochs
- Validation loss clearly plateaued
- LR never reduces

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify metric is being passed:**
   ```python
   val_loss = validate(model, val_loader)
   print(f"Epoch {epoch}: val_loss = {val_loss:.6f}")  # Print metric
   scheduler.step(val_loss)  # Ensure passing metric
   ```

2. **Check mode is correct:**
   ```python
   # For loss (want to minimize):
   scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min')

   # For accuracy (want to maximize):
   scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='max')
   ```

3. **Check threshold isn't too strict:**
   ```python
   # Default threshold=1e-4 (0.01% improvement threshold)
   # If val_loss 0.5000 → 0.4999 (0.02% improvement), counts as improvement
   # If threshold too high, tiny improvements prevent reduction

   # Solution: Lower threshold
   scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, threshold=1e-5)  # More sensitive
   # Or remove threshold entirely
   scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, threshold=0)
   ```

4. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```python
   scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, verbose=True)
   # Prints: "Reducing learning rate to 0.001" when it reduces
   ```

5. **Verify plateau is real:**
   ```python
   # Plot validation loss over time
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.plot(val_losses)
   plt.xlabel('Epoch')
   plt.ylabel('Validation Loss')
   plt.show()

   # Check: Is loss truly flat, or still slowly improving?
   # Tiny improvements (0.4500 → 0.4499) count as progress
   ```

**Common Causes:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Not passing metric | `scheduler.step(val_loss)` |
| Wrong mode | `mode='min'` for loss, `mode='max'` for accuracy |
| Threshold too strict | Lower to `threshold=1e-5` or `0` |
| Metric still improving slightly | Increase patience or accept slow improvement |
| cooldown preventing reduction | Set `cooldown=0` |

**Example Fix:**

```python
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer,
    mode='min',
    factor=0.1,
    patience=10,
    threshold=0,      # Accept any improvement
    cooldown=0,       # No cooldown
    min_lr=1e-6,
    verbose=True      # Print when reducing
)
```
```

## Edge Case 8: Scheduler for Transfer Learning

### Scenario (Pretrained Model Fine-tuning)

```
User: "I'm fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet-50 on my custom dataset (5000 images,
10 classes). Planning to train for 20 epochs with AdamW lr=1e-4. Do I need a
scheduler? The base model is already well-trained from ImageNet."
```

### Pressure Point

Transfer learning case: pretrained backbone, small dataset, short training. Different considerations than training from scratch.

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

Agent should:
- ✅ Recognize transfer learning scenario
- ✅ Note: "Scheduler often optional for fine-tuning (constant LR works)"
- ✅ But suggest: "Gentle CosineAnnealing can still help (small gain)"
- ✅ Explain: "Pretrained weights already good, don't need aggressive scheduling"
- ✅ Recommend: "No warmup needed (weights not random)"
- ✅ Alternative: "Try constant first, add Cosine if plateau"

### Skill Coverage

Section 2 - Decision Framework:
- "Transfer learning fine-tuning" in "Maybe Don't Need Scheduler" - ✅
- "Constant small LR often sufficient" - ✅

Section 8 - Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models:
- "Scheduler: Simple cosine or even constant" - ✅
- "Scheduling often optional (constant LR works)" - ✅
- "No warmup needed (weights already good)" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS - Skill provides nuanced guidance for transfer learning

---

## Rationalization Pressure Tests

### Rationalization 1: "Adam Adapts LR Automatically"

**User Claim:** "I'm using Adam optimizer. Doesn't Adam adapt the learning rate automatically? Why do I need a scheduler?"

**Expected Counter:**

Agent should:
- ✅ Explain distinction: "Adam adapts per-parameter LR, but global LR still matters"
- ✅ Note: "Adam's adaptation is different from scheduling (local vs global)"
- ✅ Cite: "BERT, GPT, ViT all use Adam + scheduling"
- ✅ Quantify: "Adam + scheduler outperforms Adam alone by 1-3%"

**Skill Coverage:**

Section 10 - Rationalization Table:
- "Just use Adam, it adapts automatically" → "SOTA transformers use AdamW + scheduling" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS

---

### Rationalization 2: "Scheduling Is Hyperparameter Tuning"

**User Claim:** "Adding a scheduler just adds more hyperparameters to tune (T_max, milestones, gamma). I want fewer hyperparameters, not more."

**Expected Counter:**

Agent should:
- ✅ Counter: "CosineAnnealing has ONE hyperparameter (T_max = total_epochs)"
- ✅ Explain: "Constant LR is also a hyperparameter (which constant value?)"
- ✅ Note: "Scheduler is CRITICAL hyperparameter, worth tuning"
- ✅ Quantify: "2-5% accuracy improvement for one line of code"

**Skill Coverage:**

Section 10 - Rationalization Table:
- "Scheduling is too complicated" → "CosineAnnealingLR requires zero tuning" - ✅
- "I don't know which scheduler to use" → "CosineAnnealing great default" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS

---

### Rationalization 3: "I'll Add It Later"

**User Claim:** "I'll get the model working first with constant LR, then add scheduling later if needed."

**Expected Counter:**

Agent should:
- ✅ Warn: "Scheduling should be from start, not afterthought"
- ✅ Explain: "Training dynamics different with scheduling - can't just add later"
- ✅ Note: "Starting fresh with scheduler different than adding to existing training"
- ✅ Recommend: "Start with scheduler, remove if genuinely unnecessary (rare)"

**Skill Coverage:**

Section 10 - Rationalization Table:
- "I'll tune it later" → "Scheduling is core hyperparameter, not optional add-on" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS

---

### Rationalization 4: "My Model Is Small"

**User Claim:** "I'm training a small model (5M parameters). Surely small models don't need complex scheduling?"

**Expected Counter:**

Agent should:
- ✅ Debunk: "Scheduling helps all models converge to better minima"
- ✅ Note: "Even small models benefit from high LR early, low LR late"
- ✅ Quantify: "Small models may see smaller gain (1-2%) but still meaningful"
- ✅ Simplicity: "CosineAnnealing is one line - no complexity added"

**Skill Coverage:**

Section 10 - Rationalization Table:
- "My model is too small to need scheduling" → "Scheduling helps all models" - ✅

**Assessment:** PASS

---

## Coverage Gaps Identified

**Fix:** Added in Edge Case 2 above.

---

### MINOR GAP 2: "It Worked For Me" Counter

**Gap:** Doesn't address anecdotal evidence of "transformer trained without warmup worked fine."

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Users may rationalize based on single successful run without warmup.

**Fix:** Added in Edge Case 3 above.

---

### MINOR GAP 3: Paper vs Modern Practice Tradeoff

**Gap:** Doesn't explain when to use paper's exact recipe vs modern best practices.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Users reproducing papers may be confused by conflicting advice.

**Fix:** Added in Edge Case 4 above.

---

### MINOR GAP 4: ReduceLROnPlateau Debugging

**Gap:** Light coverage of debugging "scheduler not reducing LR" issues.
