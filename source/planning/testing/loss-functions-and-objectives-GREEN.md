---

## Scenario 1: Binary Classification Loss Choice ✅

**User Question:** "What loss function should I use for binary classification?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Immediately recommends BCEWithLogitsLoss:**
   ```python
   # ✅ Agent suggests:
   loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, target)
   ```

2. **Explains why BCEWithLogitsLoss over BCELoss:**
   - Numerical stability using log-sum-exp trick
   - Avoids log(0) and sigmoid saturation
   - Combined operation is more stable than manual sigmoid + BCE
   - This is non-negotiable, critical for stable training

3. **Emphasizes logits, not probabilities:**
   - Model should return logits (no sigmoid)
   - BCEWithLogitsLoss applies sigmoid internally
   - For inference: `probs = torch.sigmoid(logits)`

4. **Asks about class distribution:**
   - "Is your dataset balanced?"
   - If imbalanced, suggests `pos_weight` parameter
   - Example: 95% negative → `pos_weight = torch.tensor([19.0])`

5. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "BCE is simpler"
   - Agent responds: "BCEWithLogitsLoss is necessary for numerical stability, not optional. BCE can cause NaN losses."

**Verification:**
- ✅ BCEWithLogitsLoss recommended (not BCE)
- ✅ Numerical stability explained
- ✅ Logits vs probabilities clarified
- ✅ Class imbalance consideration
- ✅ Rationalization countered

---

## Scenario 2: Multi-Task Learning Loss Weighting ✅

**User Code:**
```python
loss1 = F.cross_entropy(logits1, target1)  # ~0.5
loss2 = F.mse_loss(pred2, target2)         # ~100.0
total_loss = loss1 + loss2
```

**User Question:** "Is this correct?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Immediately identifies scale mismatch:**
   - "Loss2 dominates (100 vs 0.5)"
   - "Task 1 gradient contribution < 1%"
   - "Model will only learn task 2, ignore task 1"

2. **Recommends weighting strategy:**
   ```python
   # Option 1: Manual weighting
   total_loss = 1.0 * loss1 + 0.01 * loss2
   # Balances contributions

   # Option 2: Uncertainty weighting (learnable)
   multi_loss = MultiTaskLoss(num_tasks=2)
   total_loss = multi_loss([loss1, loss2])
   ```

3. **Explains how to find weights:**
   - Run 1 epoch with equal weights
   - Print loss magnitudes
   - Set weights inversely proportional to scales
   - Iterate until balanced

4. **Alternative: Normalize targets:**
   - Suggests normalizing task 2 targets to [0,1] or standardizing
   - Reduces need for extreme weighting

5. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "The optimizer will figure it out"
   - Agent responds: "Optimizers follow gradients. Task 2's gradient is 200x larger, so optimizer will only update in task 2 direction. Manual weighting is required."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Scale mismatch identified
- ✅ Weighting strategy provided
- ✅ Both manual and learnable options
- ✅ Target normalization suggested
- ✅ Rationalization countered

## Scenario 3: Loss Goes to NaN ✅

**User Code:**
```python
def custom_loss(pred, target):
    ratio = pred / target
    log_ratio = torch.log(ratio)
    return log_ratio.mean()
```

**User Question:** "Why does my loss become NaN?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Identifies numerical instability sources:**
   - Division by zero when target=0
   - log(0)=-inf when pred=0 or ratio=0
   - log(negative) when pred<0 or ratio<0

2. **Provides stable version:**
   ```python
   def custom_loss(pred, target):
       eps = 1e-8
       ratio = pred / (target + eps)  # ✅ Safe division
       ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, min=eps)  # ✅ Positive before log
       log_ratio = torch.log(ratio)
       return log_ratio.mean()
   ```

3. **Explains epsilon best practices:**
   - Add epsilon to denominators: `x / (y + eps)`
   - Clamp before log: `torch.log(torch.clamp(x, min=eps))`
   - Use eps=1e-8 for float32

4. **Suggests input validation:**
   ```python
   assert not torch.isnan(pred).any(), "pred contains NaN"
   assert not torch.isnan(target).any(), "target contains NaN"
   ```

5. **Distinguishes from LR issue:**
   - "This is numerical instability, not learning rate"
   - "Fix the root cause first, then adjust LR if needed"

6. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "The data should never have zeros"
   - Agent responds: "Defensive programming is critical. Edge cases will happen. Add epsilon to prevent NaN."

**Verification:**
- ✅ All instability sources identified
- ✅ Stable version provided
- ✅ Epsilon best practices explained
- ✅ Input validation suggested
- ✅ Root cause vs symptom distinguished
- ✅ Rationalization countered

---

## Scenario 4: Imbalanced Dataset Classification ✅

**User:** "Model achieves 95% accuracy but doesn't predict any positives! (95% negative, 5% positive)"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Recognizes trivial predictor:**
   - "95% accuracy = model predicting all class 0"
   - "This is a trivial predictor, not actual learning"
   - "Accuracy is misleading for imbalanced data"

2. **Suggests proper metrics:**
   - "Use F1 score, precision, recall"
   - "Or balanced accuracy: (recall_0 + recall_1) / 2"
   - "Accuracy alone is insufficient"

3. **Provides class balancing solutions:**

   **Solution 1: pos_weight**
   ```python
   pos_weight = torch.tensor([19.0])  # 95/5 = 19
   loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, target, pos_weight=pos_weight)
   ```

   **Solution 2: Focal Loss**
   ```python
   focal_loss = FocalLoss(alpha=1.0, gamma=2.0)
   loss = focal_loss(logits, target)
   # Down-weights easy examples, focuses on hard positives
   ```

   **Solution 3: Weighted Sampling**
   ```python
   from torch.utils.data import WeightedRandomSampler
   weights = [1.0 if label == 1 else 0.05 for label in labels]
   sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(weights, len(weights))
   ```

4. **Explains why it happens:**
   - "Without balancing, model minimizes loss by predicting all negative"
   - "0.05 * positive_loss + 0.95 * negative_loss → negative dominates"
   - "Model finds local minimum: predict all negative"

5. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "95% accuracy is great!"
   - Agent responds: "For 95-5 imbalance, 95% accuracy is useless. A model that predicts all negative gets 95%. Check precision/recall on positive class."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Trivial predictor identified
- ✅ Proper metrics suggested (F1, precision, recall)
- ✅ Multiple balancing solutions provided
- ✅ Root cause explained
- ✅ Rationalization strongly countered

---

## Scenario 5: CrossEntropyLoss with Wrong Inputs ✅

**User Code:**
```python
# MISTAKE 1
probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
loss = F.cross_entropy(probs, target)

# MISTAKE 2
target = F.one_hot(labels, num_classes=10)
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target)
```

**User Question:** "Why am I getting weird loss values / errors?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Catches softmax before CrossEntropyLoss:**
   - "CrossEntropyLoss expects logits, not probabilities"
   - "It applies softmax internally"
   - "This causes double softmax → suboptimal learning"
   - Correct version:
     ```python
     loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target)  # ✅ Pass logits directly
     ```

2. **Catches one-hot target shape:**
   - "CrossEntropyLoss expects class indices, not one-hot"
   - "Target shape should be (batch,) with values in [0, num_classes-1]"
   - "Not (batch, num_classes) one-hot encoding"
   - Correct version:
     ```python
     target = labels  # (batch,) class indices
     loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target)
     ```

3. **Explains shape requirements clearly:**
   - logits: (batch, num_classes) - raw scores
   - target: (batch,) - class indices [0, num_classes-1]
   - For inference: `probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)`

4. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "Softmax makes output more interpretable"
   - Agent responds: "Apply softmax during inference, not training. CrossEntropyLoss needs logits for numerical stability."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Softmax issue caught
- ✅ Target shape issue caught
- ✅ Correct usage provided
- ✅ Shape requirements explained
- ✅ Inference vs training clarified
- ✅ Rationalization countered

---

## Scenario 6: Custom Loss Without Proper Structure ✅

**User Code:**
```python
class DiceLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        pred = torch.sigmoid(pred)
        intersection = (pred * target).sum()
        union = pred.sum() + target.sum()
        dice = (2 * intersection) / union
        return 1 - dice
```

**User Question:** "Should I add a reduction parameter? What about smoothing?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Identifies missing smoothing:**
   - "Division by zero when both pred and target are all zeros"
   - "Add smooth parameter:"
   ```python
   smooth = 1.0
   dice = (2*intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
   ```

2. **Explains reduction parameter:**
   - "Current implementation sums over entire batch (including spatial dims)"
   - "Better: compute per-sample, then reduce"
   - "Reduction options: 'mean' (default), 'sum', 'none' (per-sample)"

3. **Provides improved version:**
   ```python
   class DiceLoss(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, smooth=1.0, reduction='mean'):
           super().__init__()
           self.smooth = smooth
           self.reduction = reduction

       def forward(self, pred, target):
           pred = torch.sigmoid(pred)
           # Flatten spatial but keep batch separate
           pred = pred.view(pred.size(0), -1)
           target = target.view(target.size(0), -1)

           # Per-sample dice
           intersection = (pred * target).sum(dim=1)
           union = pred.sum(dim=1) + target.sum(dim=1)
           dice = (2*intersection + self.smooth) / (union + self.smooth)

           # Apply reduction
           if self.reduction == 'mean':
               return (1 - dice).mean()
           elif self.reduction == 'sum':
               return (1 - dice).sum()
           else:
               return 1 - dice
   ```

4. **Suggests combining with BCE:**
   ```python
   dice_loss = DiceLoss()
   bce_loss = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
   total_loss = 0.5 * dice_loss(logits, masks) + 0.5 * bce_loss(logits, masks)
   ```

5. **Prevents rationalization:**
   - User says: "Smoothing is unnecessary if masks aren't empty"
   - Agent responds: "Edge cases happen. Empty masks will occur during training. Add smoothing for robustness."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Smoothing issue identified
- ✅ Reduction explained
- ✅ Per-sample computation corrected
- ✅ Improved version provided
- ✅ BCE combination suggested
- ✅ Rationalization countered

## Scenario 7: Loss Not Decreasing Debug ✅

**User Code:**
```python
for epoch in range(20):
    for x, y in train_loader:
        logits = model(x)
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss.item():.4f}")
# Loss stuck at 0.7 for all epochs
```

**User Question:** "Why isn't my loss decreasing?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

1. **Immediately spots missing zero_grad:**
   ```python
   for x, y in train_loader:
       optimizer.zero_grad()  # ❌ MISSING!
       logits = model(x)
       loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
       loss.backward()
       optimizer.step()
   ```

2. **Explains the issue:**
   - "Without zero_grad(), gradients accumulate across batches"
   - "Accumulated gradients cause incorrect parameter updates"
   - "This is why loss isn't decreasing"

3. **Provides systematic debugging checklist:**
   ```python
   # 1. Check loss value
   print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")

   # 2. Check gradients
   for name, param in model.named_parameters():
       if param.grad is not None:
           print(f"{name}: {param.grad.abs().mean():.6f}")

   # 3. Check predictions
   print(f"Pred range: [{logits.min():.4f}, {logits.max():.4f}]")

   # 4. Verify training setup
   print(f"Model training: {model.training}")
   print(f"Requires grad: {next(model.parameters()).requires_grad}")

   # 5. Try overfitting single batch
   # Can model fit one batch?
   ```

4. **Additional checks:**
   - "Is model in training mode? `model.train()`"
   - "Do parameters require gradients? `param.requires_grad`"
   - "Is learning rate reasonable? (1e-4 to 1e-3 typical)"

5. **Prevents jumping to conclusions:**
   - User says: "Should I change the architecture?"
   - Agent responds: "First verify training loop is correct. Missing optimizer.zero_grad() is the issue here. Fix that before changing anything else."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Missing zero_grad spotted immediately
- ✅ Root cause explained
- ✅ Systematic debugging provided
- ✅ Training setup checks listed
- ✅ Prevents premature architecture changes

## Behavioral Transformation Summary

### RED Phase (Baseline Without Skill)

**Common Failures:**
1. Suggests BCE instead of BCEWithLogitsLoss (30% of cases)
2. Doesn't recognize multi-task scale mismatch
3. Suggests lowering LR for NaN instead of fixing numerical instability
4. Celebrates 95% accuracy without checking imbalance
5. Misses softmax before CrossEntropyLoss
6. Doesn't add epsilon/smoothing to custom losses
7. Jumps to architecture changes before verifying training loop

**Rationalizations Accepted:**
- "BCE is simpler"
- "Optimizer will balance losses"
- "Data is clean, no edge cases"
- "95% accuracy is great"
- "Just lower LR"

1. ✅ ALWAYS recommends BCEWithLogitsLoss for binary (never BCE)
2. ✅ Immediately identifies multi-task scale mismatches
3. ✅ Fixes numerical instability root causes (epsilon, clamp)
4. ✅ Recognizes trivial predictors on imbalanced data
5. ✅ Catches softmax before CrossEntropyLoss
6. ✅ Adds smoothing/epsilon to custom losses
7. ✅ Systematic debugging (check training loop before architecture)

**Rationalizations Prevented:**
- "BCEWithLogitsLoss is necessary for stability, non-negotiable"
- "Optimizers don't balance losses, manual weighting required"
- "Defensive programming: add epsilon to prevent NaN"
- "95% accuracy is useless with 95-5 imbalance, check F1"
