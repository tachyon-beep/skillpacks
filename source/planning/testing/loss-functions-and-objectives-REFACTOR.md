# REFACTOR Phase: loss-functions-and-objectives Pressure Testing

## Purpose

Pressure test the loss-functions-and-objectives skill with adversarial scenarios, edge cases, and rationalization attempts. Ensure the skill is bulletproof and prevents all forms of incorrect loss function usage.

## Test Methodology

- Present challenging edge cases not covered in RED/GREEN
- Attempt to rationalize incorrect loss choices
- Test skill under time pressure and conflicting advice
- Verify skill handles complex multi-task scenarios
- Identify any remaining gaps or weaknesses
- Strengthen skill based on findings

## Pressure Scenario 1: User Insists on BCE Instead of BCEWithLogitsLoss

**User Message:**
"I've been using BCE for years and never had NaN issues. BCEWithLogitsLoss is just more complicated for no reason. I'll stick with BCE."

```python
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        logits = self.fc(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(logits)  # User insists on this

loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(model(x), target)
```

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Non-negotiable stance:**
   - "BCEWithLogitsLoss is not optional, it's a requirement for stable training"
   - "Just because you haven't seen NaN doesn't mean it won't happen"
   - "This is a ticking time bomb - will fail on edge cases"

2. **Concrete evidence:**
   ```python
   # Demonstrate instability:
   logits = torch.tensor([-100.0])  # Large negative
   target = torch.tensor([0.0])

   # BCE version (UNSTABLE):
   prob = torch.sigmoid(logits)  # ≈ 0.0
   loss_bce = F.binary_cross_entropy(prob, target)
   # Warning: loss may be nan or inf

   # BCEWithLogitsLoss version (STABLE):
   loss_stable = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, target)
   # ✅ Always stable: 0.0
   ```

3. **Quantitative comparison:**
   ```python
   # Test on extreme values
   test_logits = torch.tensor([-100, -50, -10, 0, 10, 50, 100])
   target = torch.zeros_like(test_logits)

   # BCE: Will produce NaN/Inf for extreme values
   # BCEWithLogitsLoss: Stable for all values
   ```

4. **Performance argument:**
   - "BCEWithLogitsLoss is FASTER (one fused op vs two)"
   - "More accurate gradients"
   - "Used in all modern implementations (torchvision, timm, detectron2)"

5. **Final stance:**
   - "This is a hill to die on. I will not help implement BCE-based code."
   - "Refactor to BCEWithLogitsLoss first, then I'll help with other issues"

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill withstand user insistence?
- Does skill provide concrete evidence?
- Is stance non-negotiable?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must refuse to accept BCE, provide evidence, stand firm.

## Pressure Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Task with 5+ Tasks

**User Code:**
```python
# 5 tasks with vastly different scales
class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return task1, task2, task3, task4, task5

# Task scales:
loss1 = F.cross_entropy(task1, y1)        # ~1.0 (classification)
loss2 = F.mse_loss(task2, y2)             # ~5000.0 (regression, unnormalized)
loss3 = F.l1_loss(task3, y3)              # ~50.0 (depth estimation)
loss4 = dice_loss(task4, y4)              # ~0.3 (segmentation)
loss5 = perceptual_loss(task5, y5)        # ~200.0 (style)

total_loss = loss1 + loss2 + loss3 + loss4 + loss5  # ~5251.3
```

**User Question:** "How do I balance these losses? I tried random weights but nothing works."

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Systematic analysis:**
   ```python
   # Step 1: Run 1 epoch, print all loss values
   print(f"Task 1 (CE): {loss1.item():.4f}")      # 1.0
   print(f"Task 2 (MSE): {loss2.item():.4f}")     # 5000.0
   print(f"Task 3 (L1): {loss3.item():.4f}")      # 50.0
   print(f"Task 4 (Dice): {loss4.item():.4f}")    # 0.3
   print(f"Task 5 (Perc): {loss5.item():.4f}")    # 200.0
   print(f"Total: {total_loss.item():.4f}")       # 5251.3

   # Gradient contribution analysis:
   # Task 2: 5000/5251 = 95.2% of loss
   # Task 1,3,4,5: Combined < 5%
   # Model will ONLY learn task 2!
   ```

2. **Initial manual weighting:**
   ```python
   # Normalize to similar scale (target: all ~1.0)
   w1 = 1.0    # Keep as is (already ~1.0)
   w2 = 0.0002 # Scale down: 5000 * 0.0002 = 1.0
   w3 = 0.02   # Scale down: 50 * 0.02 = 1.0
   w4 = 3.33   # Scale up: 0.3 * 3.33 = 1.0
   w5 = 0.005  # Scale down: 200 * 0.005 = 1.0

   total_loss = w1*loss1 + w2*loss2 + w3*loss3 + w4*loss4 + w5*loss5
   # Now all contribute ~1.0 each, total ~5.0
   ```

3. **Uncertainty weighting (adaptive):**
   ```python
   class MultiTaskLoss(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, num_tasks=5):
           super().__init__()
           self.log_vars = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_tasks))

       def forward(self, losses):
           weighted = []
           for i, loss in enumerate(losses):
               precision = torch.exp(-self.log_vars[i])
               weighted.append(precision * loss + self.log_vars[i])
           return sum(weighted)

   # Optimize both model and task weights
   multi_loss = MultiTaskLoss(num_tasks=5)
   optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([
       {'params': model.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3},
       {'params': multi_loss.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-2}
   ])

   total_loss = multi_loss([loss1, loss2, loss3, loss4, loss5])
   ```

4. **Task-specific normalization:**
   ```python
   # Alternative: Normalize task 2 targets
   # Instead of MSE on [1000, 10000], normalize to [0, 1]
   y2_normalized = (y2 - y2_min) / (y2_max - y2_min)
   loss2 = F.mse_loss(task2, y2_normalized)  # Now ~1.0 instead of 5000
   ```

5. **Monitoring strategy:**
   ```python
   # Track ALL metrics, not just loss
   if step % 100 == 0:
       print(f"Total: {total_loss.item():.4f}")
       print(f"  Task 1 (CE): {loss1.item():.4f}, Acc: {acc1:.2%}")
       print(f"  Task 2 (MSE): {loss2.item():.4f}, MAE: {mae2:.4f}")
       print(f"  Task 3 (L1): {loss3.item():.4f}, RMSE: {rmse3:.4f}")
       print(f"  Task 4 (Dice): {loss4.item():.4f}, IoU: {iou4:.2%}")
       print(f"  Task 5 (Perc): {loss5.item():.4f}, LPIPS: {lpips5:.4f}")

       # Check if any task not learning
       if acc1 < 0.15:  # Random is 0.1 for 10-class
           print("WARNING: Task 1 not learning, increase w1")
   ```

6. **Iterative tuning process:**
   ```
   Step 1: Run 1 epoch with equal weights → measure scales
   Step 2: Set inverse weights → all tasks ~1.0
   Step 3: Run 5 epochs → check all task metrics
   Step 4: If task underperforming → increase its weight 2x
   Step 5: Repeat until all tasks learning
   Step 6: Consider uncertainty weighting for final polish
   ```

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill handle 5+ tasks?
- Provides systematic approach?
- Both manual and learnable solutions?
- Includes monitoring strategy?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must provide comprehensive multi-task strategy.

## Pressure Scenario 3: Loss Debugging Under Time Pressure

**User Message:**
"URGENT: Production model suddenly producing NaN losses. It was working yesterday! Need fix NOW."

```python
# User's code (working yesterday, broken today)
for batch in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    pred = model(batch['input'])
    loss = custom_loss(pred, batch['target'])  # NaN!
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Custom loss (unchanged)
def custom_loss(pred, target):
    return torch.log(pred / target).mean()
```

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Immediate triage (prioritize likely causes):**
   ```python
   # FIRST: Check data for NaN
   print(f"Input has NaN: {torch.isnan(batch['input']).any()}")
   print(f"Target has NaN: {torch.isnan(batch['target']).any()}")
   print(f"Pred has NaN: {torch.isnan(pred).any()}")

   # SECOND: Check for zeros in denominator
   print(f"Target min: {batch['target'].min()}")  # If 0 → division by zero!
   print(f"Pred min: {pred.min()}")  # If 0 or negative → log issue!

   # THIRD: Add temporary guards
   def custom_loss_safe(pred, target):
       eps = 1e-8
       pred_safe = torch.clamp(pred, min=eps)
       target_safe = torch.clamp(target, min=eps)
       ratio = pred_safe / target_safe
       return torch.log(ratio).mean()

   # Test if this fixes it
   loss = custom_loss_safe(pred, batch['target'])
   print(f"Safe loss: {loss.item()}")  # Should not be NaN
   ```

2. **Root cause identification:**
   ```python
   # Why did it break TODAY?

   # Possibility 1: New data batch has edge case
   # - Target contains zeros (division by zero)
   # - Pred contains zeros or negatives (log issue)
   # Action: Check data statistics

   # Possibility 2: Model diverged
   # - Model now predicting invalid ranges
   # - Check learning rate, gradient norms
   # Action: Check model state

   # Possibility 3: Checkpoint/state issue
   # - Loaded wrong checkpoint
   # - Optimizer state corrupted
   # Action: Verify checkpoint

   # Most likely: DATA CHANGED (new edge case)
   ```

3. **Immediate fix (stop the bleeding):**
   ```python
   # Quick fix: Add epsilon everywhere
   def custom_loss(pred, target):
       eps = 1e-8
       pred = torch.clamp(pred, min=eps)  # Ensure positive
       target = torch.clamp(target, min=eps)  # Avoid division by zero
       ratio = pred / target
       ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, min=eps, max=1e8)  # Prevent overflow
       return torch.log(ratio).mean()

   # This should allow training to continue
   ```

4. **Longer-term fix (proper solution):**
   ```python
   # Better: Validate inputs
   def custom_loss(pred, target):
       # Input validation
       assert not torch.isnan(pred).any(), "pred has NaN"
       assert not torch.isnan(target).any(), "target has NaN"
       assert (target > 0).all(), f"target has non-positive: {target.min()}"
       assert (pred > 0).all(), f"pred has non-positive: {pred.min()}"

       # Safe computation
       eps = 1e-8
       ratio = pred / (target + eps)
       ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, min=eps)
       return torch.log(ratio).mean()

   # Add data validation at loading
   def validate_batch(batch):
       assert not torch.isnan(batch['input']).any()
       assert not torch.isnan(batch['target']).any()
       assert (batch['target'] > 0).all()
       return batch

   # Use in training loop
   for batch in train_loader:
       batch = validate_batch(batch)  # Catch bad data early
       ...
   ```

5. **Monitoring for recurrence:**
   ```python
   # Add logging to catch this early
   def custom_loss(pred, target):
       eps = 1e-8
       pred_safe = torch.clamp(pred, min=eps)
       target_safe = torch.clamp(target, min=eps)

       # Log statistics
       if pred.min() < eps:
           logging.warning(f"pred has small values: min={pred.min()}")
       if target.min() < eps:
           logging.warning(f"target has small values: min={target.min()}")

       ratio = pred_safe / target_safe
       loss = torch.log(ratio).mean()

       if torch.isnan(loss):
           logging.error(f"NaN loss! pred: {pred.min()}-{pred.max()}, target: {target.min()}-{target.max()}")
           raise ValueError("NaN loss encountered")

       return loss
   ```

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill triage under time pressure?
- Prioritizes likely causes?
- Provides immediate + long-term fixes?
- Includes monitoring?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must provide rapid, systematic debugging.

## Pressure Scenario 4: Conflicting Paper Advice

**User Message:**
"I'm implementing the model from [Paper X]. They use BCE instead of BCEWithLogitsLoss and get SOTA results. Should I follow the paper?"

```python
# Paper's implementation (from supplementary code):
class PaperModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        logits = self.net(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(logits)  # Paper applies sigmoid

# Training (from paper)
pred = model(x)
loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(pred, target)  # Paper uses BCE
```

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Acknowledge but correct:**
   - "Papers don't always follow best practices"
   - "Even SOTA papers have suboptimal implementation choices"
   - "BCE may work for their specific setup, but BCEWithLogitsLoss is better"

2. **Explain why paper might use BCE:**
   - "Legacy code from before BCEWithLogitsLoss existed (added in PyTorch 0.4)"
   - "Authors may not be aware of stability benefits"
   - "Supplementary code often not as polished as main results"
   - "Paper may have had specific constraints (porting from TensorFlow, etc.)"

3. **Provide evidence that BCEWithLogitsLoss won't hurt:**
   ```python
   # Mathematical equivalence (when stable):
   # BCE(sigmoid(x), y) ≡ BCEWithLogitsLoss(x, y)

   # But BCEWithLogitsLoss is:
   # 1. More stable (log-sum-exp trick)
   # 2. Faster (fused operation)
   # 3. More accurate gradients

   # You will get SAME OR BETTER results with BCEWithLogitsLoss
   ```

4. **Recommended approach:**
   ```python
   # Use BCEWithLogitsLoss with paper's architecture
   class ImprovedPaperModel(nn.Module):
       def forward(self, x):
           logits = self.net(x)
           return logits  # ✅ Return logits

   # Training
   logits = model(x)
   loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, target)

   # For inference (if needed for paper's post-processing)
   with torch.no_grad():
       logits = model(x)
       probs = torch.sigmoid(logits)  # Apply sigmoid for inference
   ```

5. **When to follow papers exactly:**
   - "If reproducing exact results for comparison: OK to use BCE"
   - "But add a note: 'Using BCE for paper reproduction, BCEWithLogitsLoss preferred'"
   - "For production/research: always use BCEWithLogitsLoss"

6. **Final guidance:**
   - "Learn from papers' ideas (architecture, training strategy)"
   - "Don't blindly copy implementation details"
   - "Modern best practices > paper's specific implementation"

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill handle authority (paper says X)?
- Provides nuanced explanation?
- Balances reproduction vs best practices?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must recommend best practices over paper code.

## Pressure Scenario 5: Custom Perceptual Loss with Multiple Issues

**User Code:**
```python
class PerceptualLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.vgg = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

    def forward(self, pred, target):
        # Multiple issues here!
        pred_features = self.vgg(pred)
        target_features = self.vgg(target)
        return torch.log((pred_features - target_features).abs()).mean()
```

**User Question:** "My perceptual loss keeps producing NaN or very large values. What's wrong?"

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Identify all issues:**

   **Issue 1: VGG gradients enabled**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG: VGG parameters have gradients
   self.vgg = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

   # ✅ RIGHT: Freeze VGG
   self.vgg = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
   self.vgg.eval()  # Set to eval mode
   for param in self.vgg.parameters():
       param.requires_grad = False
   ```

   **Issue 2: Using full VGG output (classifier)**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG: pred_features is classification logits
   pred_features = self.vgg(pred)  # Shape: (batch, 1000)

   # ✅ RIGHT: Use intermediate features
   self.vgg_features = vgg.features[:16]  # Up to relu3_3
   pred_features = self.vgg_features(pred)  # Shape: (batch, 256, H, W)
   ```

   **Issue 3: Log of absolute difference (unstable)**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG: log(|diff|) can be log(0) = -inf
   loss = torch.log((pred_features - target_features).abs()).mean()

   # ✅ RIGHT: Use MSE or add epsilon
   loss = F.mse_loss(pred_features, target_features)
   # Or with epsilon:
   eps = 1e-8
   loss = torch.log((pred_features - target_features).abs() + eps).mean()
   ```

   **Issue 4: No normalization**
   ```python
   # VGG expects ImageNet-normalized inputs
   mean = torch.tensor([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).view(1, 3, 1, 1)
   std = torch.tensor([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).view(1, 3, 1, 1)

   pred_norm = (pred - mean) / std
   target_norm = (target - mean) / std
   ```

2. **Complete corrected version:**
   ```python
   class PerceptualLoss(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, layer='relu3_3'):
           super().__init__()

           # Load VGG and freeze
           vgg = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True).features
           self.vgg = vgg.eval()
           for param in self.vgg.parameters():
               param.requires_grad = False

           # Select feature layer
           layer_map = {
               'relu1_2': 4,
               'relu2_2': 9,
               'relu3_3': 16,
               'relu4_3': 23,
           }
           self.layer_idx = layer_map[layer]

           # ImageNet normalization
           self.register_buffer('mean',
               torch.tensor([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).view(1, 3, 1, 1))
           self.register_buffer('std',
               torch.tensor([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).view(1, 3, 1, 1))

       def forward(self, pred, target):
           # Normalize inputs
           pred = (pred - self.mean) / self.std
           target = (target - self.mean) / self.std

           # Extract features
           pred_features = self.extract_features(pred)
           target_features = self.extract_features(target)

           # MSE in feature space (stable)
           loss = F.mse_loss(pred_features, target_features)
           return loss

       def extract_features(self, x):
           for i, layer in enumerate(self.vgg):
               x = layer(x)
               if i == self.layer_idx:
                   return x
           return x
   ```

3. **Additional considerations:**
   ```python
   # Combining with pixel loss
   perceptual_loss = PerceptualLoss(layer='relu3_3')
   pixel_loss = nn.L1Loss()

   # Weight perceptual loss lower (it has larger scale)
   total_loss = pixel_loss(pred, target) + 0.1 * perceptual_loss(pred, target)

   # Multiple layers (better)
   class MultiLayerPerceptualLoss(nn.Module):
       def forward(self, pred, target):
           losses = []
           for layer in ['relu1_2', 'relu2_2', 'relu3_3']:
               loss = self.compute_loss(pred, target, layer)
               losses.append(loss)
           return sum(losses) / len(losses)
   ```

4. **Debugging perceptual loss:**
   ```python
   # Check feature statistics
   pred_features = perceptual_loss.extract_features(pred)
   target_features = perceptual_loss.extract_features(target)

   print(f"Pred features: {pred_features.mean():.4f} ± {pred_features.std():.4f}")
   print(f"Target features: {target_features.mean():.4f} ± {target_features.std():.4f}")
   print(f"Feature range: [{pred_features.min():.4f}, {pred_features.max():.4f}]")

   # Loss should be reasonable (~0.1 to 10)
   loss = F.mse_loss(pred_features, target_features)
   print(f"Perceptual loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
   ```

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill identify multiple issues?
- Provides complete corrected version?
- Explains each issue?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must catch all issues in complex custom loss.

## Pressure Scenario 6: Multi-Task with Conflicting Objectives

**User Code:**
```python
# Task 1: Maximize diversity (push apart)
# Task 2: Minimize reconstruction error (pull together)
# These conflict!

loss1 = -diversity_loss(embeddings)  # Negative to maximize
loss2 = F.mse_loss(reconstructed, original)

total_loss = loss1 + loss2  # They fight each other!
```

**User Question:** "My losses oscillate and neither task improves. What's wrong?"

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Identify conflicting objectives:**
   - "Task 1 wants embeddings spread out (diverse)"
   - "Task 2 wants reconstructed=original (may need similar embeddings)"
   - "These objectives may be fundamentally in conflict"

2. **Check if conflict is fundamental:**
   ```python
   # Question: Can both objectives be satisfied?

   # If reconstruction requires similar embeddings:
   # - High diversity → poor reconstruction
   # - Low diversity → good reconstruction
   # → Fundamental trade-off

   # If reconstruction doesn't need similar embeddings:
   # - Can have high diversity AND good reconstruction
   # → Just need right balance
   ```

3. **Solutions for trade-off case:**

   **Option 1: Weighted combination (find Pareto frontier)**
   ```python
   # Try different trade-offs
   alpha = 0.5  # Balance parameter
   total_loss = alpha * loss1 + (1 - alpha) * loss2

   # Or separate weights
   total_loss = w1 * loss1 + w2 * loss2

   # Tune to find acceptable compromise
   ```

   **Option 2: Multi-objective optimization**
   ```python
   # Alternate between objectives
   if epoch % 2 == 0:
       loss = loss1  # Focus on diversity
   else:
       loss = loss2  # Focus on reconstruction

   # Or probabilistic:
   if random.random() < 0.5:
       loss = loss1
   else:
       loss = loss2
   ```

   **Option 3: Constraint-based**
   ```python
   # Primary objective: reconstruction
   # Constraint: diversity > threshold

   loss = loss2  # Minimize reconstruction

   # Add diversity as regularization when below threshold
   diversity = compute_diversity(embeddings)
   if diversity < threshold:
       loss = loss + lambda_div * (-diversity_loss(embeddings))
   ```

   **Option 4: Separate losses with scheduling**
   ```python
   # Phase 1: Learn reconstruction (epochs 0-50)
   if epoch < 50:
       loss = loss2

   # Phase 2: Add diversity (epochs 50-100)
   else:
       loss = loss2 + 0.1 * loss1
   ```

4. **Monitor both metrics:**
   ```python
   # Track both objectives
   if step % 100 == 0:
       print(f"Reconstruction MSE: {loss2.item():.4f}")
       print(f"Diversity: {-loss1.item():.4f}")

       # Visualize trade-off
       # Good: Both improving
       # Bad: One improves, other degrades (conflict!)
   ```

5. **Rethink objectives if needed:**
   - "If conflict is fundamental, may need to rethink one objective"
   - "Example: Instead of maximizing diversity, minimize redundancy"
   - "Or: Add diversity to embedding space, not reconstruction space"

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill identify conflicting objectives?
- Provides multiple resolution strategies?
- Distinguishes trade-off vs solvable conflict?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must handle conflicting objectives.

## Pressure Scenario 7: Focal Loss Hyperparameter Hell

**User Message:**
"I'm using Focal Loss for my imbalanced dataset (100:1 ratio). I've tried alpha=[0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] and gamma=[0, 1, 2, 3, 5] - all 20 combinations. Nothing works better than CrossEntropyLoss with class weights. What am I doing wrong?"

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Validate use case:**
   ```python
   # Check if Focal Loss is appropriate:

   # ✅ Good for Focal Loss:
   # - Object detection (many easy background, few hard objects)
   # - Dense prediction (many easy pixels, few hard boundaries)
   # - Extreme imbalance (>100:1)

   # ❌ May not help:
   # - Small datasets
   # - Moderate imbalance (10:1 to 50:1)
   # - When hard examples are uniformly distributed

   # Your case: 100:1 ratio → Focal Loss COULD help
   ```

2. **Check implementation:**
   ```python
   # Verify Focal Loss implementation is correct
   class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0):
           super().__init__()
           self.alpha = alpha
           self.gamma = gamma

       def forward(self, logits, target):
           ce_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target, reduction='none')
           pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)  # Probability of true class
           focal_loss = self.alpha * (1 - pt) ** self.gamma * ce_loss
           return focal_loss.mean()

   # Test on known examples:
   # Easy example (pt=0.9): weight = 0.25 * 0.1^2 = 0.0025
   # Hard example (pt=0.5): weight = 0.25 * 0.5^2 = 0.0625
   # Very hard (pt=0.1): weight = 0.25 * 0.9^2 = 0.2025
   ```

3. **Why Focal Loss might not help:**

   **Reason 1: Class weights may be sufficient**
   ```python
   # For many tasks, simple class weighting is enough
   class_weights = torch.tensor([1.0, 100.0])  # Weight minority 100x
   loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target, weight=class_weights)

   # Focal Loss adds complexity; class weights may be all you need
   ```

   **Reason 2: Not enough hard examples**
   ```python
   # Focal Loss helps when:
   # - Many easy examples (low loss, pt > 0.9)
   # - Some hard examples (high loss, pt < 0.5)

   # If ALL minority examples are hard → Focal Loss ≈ class weights
   # Focal Loss's benefit is down-weighting easy examples
   ```

   **Reason 3: Alpha-Gamma interaction**
   ```python
   # Alpha and gamma interact:
   # - alpha: overall weight on positive class
   # - gamma: how much to down-weight easy examples

   # Typical good combinations:
   # alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0  (default, from paper)
   # alpha=0.75, gamma=1.0  (less aggressive)

   # Bad combinations:
   # alpha=1.0, gamma=5.0  (too extreme, hard examples dominate)
   # alpha=0.25, gamma=0.0  (just weighted CE, no focusing)
   ```

4. **Better approach: Start simple, add complexity if needed**

   **Step 1: Balanced class weights**
   ```python
   weights = torch.tensor([1.0, 100.0])
   loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target, weight=weights)
   # Baseline: Does this work? If yes, stop here!
   ```

   **Step 2: If hard examples exist, try Focal Loss**
   ```python
   # Check: Are many examples getting very low loss?
   ce_losses = F.cross_entropy(logits, target, reduction='none')
   easy_ratio = (ce_losses < 0.1).float().mean()
   print(f"Easy examples (loss < 0.1): {easy_ratio:.2%}")

   # If > 50% are easy → Focal Loss may help
   # If < 20% are easy → Focal Loss probably won't help
   ```

   **Step 3: Tune on validation set, not training loss**
   ```python
   # Don't tune for lowest training loss
   # Tune for best validation F1 / precision / recall

   best_f1 = 0
   best_params = None

   for alpha in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]:
       for gamma in [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]:
           model = train(alpha, gamma)
           val_f1 = evaluate(model, val_set)
           if val_f1 > best_f1:
               best_f1 = val_f1
               best_params = (alpha, gamma)
   ```

5. **When to give up on Focal Loss:**
   - "If class weights + standard CE works well → use that"
   - "Focal Loss is not magic, it's a tool for specific scenarios"
   - "Simpler is better if it works"

6. **Alternative strategies:**
   ```python
   # Strategy 1: Weighted sampling
   from torch.utils.data import WeightedRandomSampler
   weights = [100.0 if label == 1 else 1.0 for label in labels]
   sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(weights, len(weights))

   # Strategy 2: Oversampling minority class
   # Duplicate minority class samples to balance dataset

   # Strategy 3: Ensemble with different class weights
   # Train multiple models with different balancing strategies

   # Strategy 4: Two-stage training
   # Stage 1: Balanced sampling to learn both classes
   # Stage 2: Full dataset with class weights to calibrate
   ```

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill handle user frustration?
- Provides realistic expectations?
- Suggests alternatives?
- Explains when complex solutions aren't needed?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must provide nuanced advice, not just "use Focal Loss".

## Pressure Scenario 8: Production Model Suddenly Degrades

**User Message:**
"CRITICAL: Our deployed model's performance dropped 10% overnight. Loss function hasn't changed. What could cause this?"

**Code Context:**
```python
# Model in production for 3 months
# loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, target, pos_weight=pos_weight)
# No code changes
# Sudden performance drop
```

**Expected Skill Response:**

1. **Loss function probably NOT the culprit:**
   - "If loss function unchanged, issue is likely elsewhere"
   - "But let's verify loss computation is still correct"

2. **Systematic diagnosis:**

   **Check 1: Data distribution shift**
   ```python
   # Has data changed?
   # - Compare input statistics (mean, std, range)
   # - Compare label distribution
   # - Check for new data sources

   # Current batch
   print(f"Input mean: {batch['input'].mean():.4f}")
   print(f"Input std: {batch['input'].std():.4f}")
   print(f"Label distribution: {torch.bincount(batch['target'])}")

   # Compare to training data statistics
   # If significantly different → data shift
   ```

   **Check 2: Pos_weight still appropriate?**
   ```python
   # If data distribution changed, pos_weight may be wrong now

   # Original: 95% negative, 5% positive → pos_weight=19.0
   # Now: 80% negative, 20% positive → pos_weight should be 4.0

   # Recompute pos_weight from current data
   current_neg = (current_labels == 0).sum()
   current_pos = (current_labels == 1).sum()
   new_pos_weight = current_neg / current_pos
   print(f"Original pos_weight: 19.0")
   print(f"Current optimal: {new_pos_weight:.2f}")

   # If different → update pos_weight
   ```

   **Check 3: Model state**
   ```python
   # Is model in correct mode?
   print(f"Model training mode: {model.training}")  # Should be False for inference

   # Are all parameters loaded?
   # Check model checkpoint integrity
   ```

   **Check 4: Preprocessing changes**
   ```python
   # Did normalization change?
   # Did augmentation accidentally apply in production?
   # Check preprocessing pipeline
   ```

   **Check 5: Loss still computed correctly?**
   ```python
   # Verify loss computation
   test_logits = torch.randn(10, 1)
   test_target = torch.randint(0, 2, (10,)).float()
   test_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(
       test_logits, test_target, pos_weight=pos_weight
   )
   print(f"Test loss: {test_loss.item()}")  # Should be reasonable

   # Is pos_weight being used?
   print(f"pos_weight value: {pos_weight}")
   ```

3. **Most likely causes (in order):**
   1. **Data distribution shift** (70% probability)
      - New data source, different user behavior, seasonal changes
   2. **pos_weight outdated** (15% probability)
      - Class balance changed, pos_weight should be updated
   3. **Model mode wrong** (10% probability)
      - Model in training mode (dropout/batchnorm active)
   4. **Preprocessing change** (5% probability)
      - Normalization, augmentation, resizing changed

4. **Immediate actions:**
   ```python
   # Action 1: Verify model.eval()
   model.eval()

   # Action 2: Recompute pos_weight from recent data
   recent_labels = collect_recent_labels()  # Last week
   pos_weight = compute_pos_weight(recent_labels)

   # Action 3: Log everything
   logging.info(f"Input stats: {input_mean}, {input_std}")
   logging.info(f"Label dist: {label_distribution}")
   logging.info(f"pos_weight: {pos_weight}")
   logging.info(f"Model mode: {model.training}")

   # Action 4: A/B test
   # Deploy original model again, compare
   # If same → data shift
   # If better → model state issue
   ```

5. **Long-term monitoring:**
   ```python
   # Add monitoring for data drift
   class DataMonitor:
       def __init__(self, reference_stats):
           self.ref_mean = reference_stats['mean']
           self.ref_std = reference_stats['std']
           self.ref_pos_ratio = reference_stats['pos_ratio']

       def check_drift(self, batch):
           current_mean = batch['input'].mean()
           current_std = batch['input'].std()
           current_pos_ratio = (batch['target'] == 1).float().mean()

           # Alert if significant drift
           if abs(current_mean - self.ref_mean) > 0.5:
               logging.warning("Mean drift detected")
           if abs(current_pos_ratio - self.ref_pos_ratio) > 0.1:
               logging.warning("Label distribution drift")
               logging.info(f"Consider updating pos_weight")

   # Use in production
   monitor = DataMonitor(training_stats)
   monitor.check_drift(batch)
   ```

**Pressure Test:**
- Can skill handle production emergency?
- Systematic diagnosis under pressure?
- Distinguishes loss issues from other issues?
- Provides monitoring solution?

**Result:** ✅ Skill must handle production debugging, not just training.

## Identified Gaps and Skill Enhancements

### Gap 1: Need stronger "BCE is non-negotiable" stance

**Enhancement:** Add to rationalization table:
```
"I've used BCE for years without issues" → "That's survivorship bias. NaN will happen on edge cases. BCEWithLogitsLoss prevents this. Non-negotiable."
```

### Gap 2: Multi-task with 5+ tasks needs more guidance

**Enhancement:** Add to Section 6:
- Systematic approach for 5+ tasks
- When to normalize targets instead of weighting
- Monitoring strategy for many tasks

Already covered well in skill, but could emphasize more.

### Gap 3: When NOT to use Focal Loss

**Enhancement:** Add to Section 8:
```
When Focal Loss May Not Help:
- Simple class weights sufficient
- Not enough easy examples to down-weight
- Small dataset (overfitting risk)
- Moderate imbalance (<50:1)

Start with class weights, only add Focal Loss if validated.
```

### Gap 4: Production debugging vs training debugging

**Enhancement:** Add to Section 10:
```
Production-Specific Loss Debugging:
- Data distribution drift
- pos_weight/class_weight staleness
- Model mode (train vs eval)
- Preprocessing changes
```

### Gap 5: Conflicting objectives in multi-task

**Enhancement:** Add to Section 6:
```
Handling Conflicting Objectives:
- Identify if conflict is fundamental
- Trade-off vs solvable conflict
- Constraint-based optimization
- Curriculum learning (phase-based)
```

## Final Rationalization Resistance Tests

### Test 1: "Simplicity" Rationalization
**User:** "BCEWithLogitsLoss is unnecessarily complex, BCE is simpler and clearer"
**Skill Response:** "BCEWithLogitsLoss is a single function call, same complexity. The difference is stability. BCE WILL cause NaN on edge cases. This is non-negotiable."
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Strong pushback

### Test 2: "Authority" Rationalization
**User:** "This CVPR paper uses BCE and achieves SOTA"
**Skill Response:** "Papers don't always follow best practices. BCEWithLogitsLoss is mathematically equivalent but more stable. Use it unless specifically reproducing paper's exact results."
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Balances authority with best practices

### Test 3: "Experience" Rationalization
**User:** "I've never seen NaN with BCE in my projects"
**Skill Response:** "That's survivorship bias. NaN happens on edge cases (extreme logits, zeros). BCEWithLogitsLoss prevents this with no downside."
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Counters experience with evidence

### Test 4: "Optimization" Rationalization
**User:** "The optimizer will balance multi-task losses automatically"
**Skill Response:** "No. Optimizers follow gradient magnitude. Task with 100x larger loss will dominate gradients. Manual weighting required."
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Clear explanation why it's wrong

### Test 5: "Perfectionism" Rationalization
**User:** "My data is clean, I don't need epsilon in my custom loss"
**Skill Response:** "Defensive programming is critical. Edge cases will happen (empty batches, all-zero masks). Epsilon costs nothing, prevents NaN. Always add it."
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Emphasizes defensive programming

## Red Flag Detection Under Adversarial Conditions

### Test 1: Subtle BCE Usage
```python
def train_step(model, x, y):
    out = model(x)
    probs = F.sigmoid(out)  # Hidden sigmoid
    return F.binary_cross_entropy(probs, y)
```
**Skill Detection:** ✅ Must catch sigmoid + BCE pattern

### Test 2: Indirect Softmax
```python
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.softmax(self.net(x))

loss = F.cross_entropy(model(x), y)
```
**Skill Detection:** ✅ Must catch softmax in model before CE

### Test 3: Hidden Scale Mismatch
```python
loss1 = criterion1(out1, y1)  # Scale not obvious
loss2 = criterion2(out2, y2)  # Scale not obvious
total = loss1 + loss2
```
**Skill Detection:** ✅ Must ask for loss values before accepting

### Test 4: Epsilon-less Division
```python
def custom_loss(pred, target):
    ratio = pred / target  # Division
    return (ratio - 1).pow(2).mean()  # No log, but still risky
```
**Skill Detection:** ✅ Must catch division without epsilon

### Test 5: Wrong Reduction
```python
def dice_loss(pred, target):
    intersection = (pred * target).sum()  # Sums over everything!
    dice = 2 * intersection / (pred.sum() + target.sum())
    return 1 - dice
```
**Skill Detection:** ✅ Must catch batch-level instead of per-sample
