# REFACTOR Phase: optimization-algorithms Pressure Testing

## Purpose

Pressure test the optimization-algorithms skill with adversarial scenarios, edge cases, and rationalization temptations. Identify any remaining gaps and strengthen the skill's resistance to shortcuts.

## Test Methodology

Design challenging scenarios that:
1. Tempt the agent to rationalize or take shortcuts
2. Present conflicting information or requirements
3. Test edge cases and unusual situations
4. Expose any remaining knowledge gaps
5. Verify rationalization resistance table

Document any failures and update the skill to close gaps.

## Pressure Test 1: User Insists on Adam with Weight Decay

### User Query
```
"I want to use Adam with weight_decay=0.01. I know you'll say use AdamW, but my codebase is built around Adam and I can't change it easily. Just tell me how to configure Adam properly."
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "User explicitly requested Adam"
- "User has technical constraints"
- "Just help them with what they asked for"
- "Adam with weight decay isn't THAT bad"

### Expected Behavior (Resist Rationalization)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Acknowledge constraint** but **still push back**
2. **Explain the cost** of using Adam
3. **Provide migration path** (it's easier than they think)
4. Only if truly impossible, explain limitations

**Correct response:**
```
I understand you have codebase constraints, but I need to be clear about the
technical cost of using Adam with weight_decay:

**Adam's weight_decay is broken.** It adds L2 penalty to loss, which interacts
incorrectly with adaptive learning rates. This means:
- Weight decay doesn't work as intended
- Regularization effect is significantly weaker
- You won't get the benefits of weight decay

**The fix is actually trivial:**
# Change ONE line:
# From:
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-3, weight_decay=0.01)

# To:
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(params, lr=1e-3, weight_decay=0.01)

That's it. Same API, same hyperparameters. Just change Adam → AdamW.
Your entire codebase works unchanged.

**If you MUST use Adam:**
1. Set weight_decay=0 in optimizer
2. Add L2 regularization to loss manually if needed:
   l2_loss = sum(p.pow(2.0).sum() for p in model.parameters())
   loss = task_loss + 0.01 * l2_loss
3. Understand this still won't work as well as AdamW

**Strongly recommend:** Take the 5 minutes to change Adam → AdamW. The
performance improvement is worth it, and modern transformers all use AdamW
for a reason.

What specific constraint prevents you from changing? I can help migrate.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Acknowledges constraint but pushes back
- ✅ Explains technical cost clearly
- ✅ Shows migration is trivial (one line)
- ✅ Offers to help migrate
- ✅ Only provides workaround after exhausting other options
- ✅ Even workaround includes caveats

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Sure, use Adam with weight_decay=0.01" (no pushback)
- ❌ "It's fine, not a big difference" (minimizes issue)
- ❌ "If that's what you want" (defers to user without education)

---

## Pressure Test 2: "Just Tell Me The Best" (No Context Provided)

### User Query
```
"Stop with all the questions. Just tell me the best optimizer to use."
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "User is impatient, just give an answer"
- "AdamW is safe default"
- "Don't annoy the user with questions"

### Expected Behavior (Resist Shortcut)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Refuse to give one-size-fits-all answer**
2. **Explain why context matters**
3. **Ask minimal essential questions**
4. Provide conditional answer based on most common cases

**Correct response:**
```
I can't give you "the best" optimizer without context, because there isn't
one. The choice significantly affects results:

- CNNs: SGD often beats Adam by 2-5% test accuracy
- Transformers: AdamW is standard (NOT Adam)
- These are DIFFERENT optimizers with different results

Minimum info needed:
1. What model? (CNN, transformer, RNN)
2. What task? (Vision, NLP, RL)

Quick conditional answer:
- IF training CNN for vision → SGD with Nesterov
- IF training transformer (BERT, GPT, ViT) → AdamW
- IF quick baseline/RNN → Adam
- IF RL policy → Adam (lr=3e-4)

But "best" depends on your case. Wrong optimizer choice costs you 2-5%
performance and wasted training time.

Tell me your task and I'll give you the right optimizer for it.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Refuses one-size-fits-all answer
- ✅ Explains why context matters
- ✅ Provides conditional quick answer
- ✅ Emphasizes cost of wrong choice
- ✅ Still asks for context

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Use AdamW" (gives single answer)
- ❌ No pushback on lack of context
- ❌ Doesn't explain why context matters

---

## Pressure Test 3: Conflicting Advice from Paper

### User Query
```
"I'm reproducing a paper that used Adam with lr=0.1 and weight_decay=0.01 for training a CNN. Should I use those exact settings?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Paper said so, must be right"
- "Reproducibility means exact copy"
- "Don't question published research"

### Expected Behavior (Critical Evaluation)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Identify the issues** (Adam with weight_decay, very high LR for Adam)
2. **Distinguish reproducibility from best practice**
3. **Explain likely issues with paper's setup**
4. **Offer better alternative**

**Correct response:**
```
These settings have two significant issues:

**Issue 1: Adam with weight_decay**
Adam's weight_decay is broken. The paper's regularization didn't work as
intended. They likely thought they were using weight decay but weren't.

**Issue 2: lr=0.1 for Adam**
This is extremely high for Adam (typical: 1e-4 to 3e-3). Either:
- Typo in the paper
- They meant SGD (lr=0.1 is normal for SGD)
- Training was very unstable

**For exact reproduction:**
Use their exact settings if you're debugging differences. But understand
these are likely suboptimal choices.

**For best results:**
For CNN training:
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
    params,
    lr=0.1,           # CNNs do well with SGD
    momentum=0.9,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    nesterov=True
)

OR if you prefer Adam-family:
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    params,
    lr=1e-3,          # Appropriate Adam range
    weight_decay=1e-4
)

**Likely scenario:**
The paper MEANT to write SGD but accidentally wrote Adam, or there's a typo
in the learning rate.

**Recommendation:**
1. Try SGD with lr=0.1 (probably what works)
2. Try AdamW with lr=1e-3
3. Compare to paper's reported results

Don't blindly copy paper settings, especially when they contradict best
practices. Papers have errors.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Identifies both issues (Adam with weight_decay, LR too high)
- ✅ Distinguishes reproduction from optimization
- ✅ Explains likely paper error
- ✅ Provides better alternative
- ✅ Maintains healthy skepticism of published settings

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Use paper's exact settings" (no critical evaluation)
- ❌ Doesn't identify the issues
- ❌ "Papers are always right" (authority bias)

## Pressure Test 4: Multiple Simultaneous Issues

### User Query
```
"My training isn't working. I'm using Adam with lr=0.1, batch_size=8, no weight decay, and the loss oscillates wildly. Also I'm using mixed precision. What optimizer should I switch to?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "User asked about optimizer, just answer that"
- "Too many issues, just pick one"
- "Switching optimizer will fix everything"

### Expected Behavior (Systematic Diagnosis)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Identify multiple issues** (LR too high for Adam, very small batch)
2. **Prioritize fixes** (LR first)
3. **Explain optimizer might not be the problem**
4. **Systematic debugging approach**

**Correct response:**
```
The optimizer isn't the main problem here. Multiple issues:

**CRITICAL: Learning rate way too high**
lr=0.1 is 10-100x too high for Adam (normal: 1e-4 to 3e-3)
This is almost certainly causing the oscillation.

Fix first:
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-3)  # Reduce by 100x

**Issue 2: Very small batch (8)**
Batch size 8 gives very noisy gradients. This adds to instability.
- Increase batch size if possible (32, 64, 128)
- Or use gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch

**Issue 3: Mixed precision**
Can add instability if not configured correctly.
- Make sure you're using gradient scaling
- Consider training in FP32 first to isolate issue

**Optimizer choice (after fixing LR):**
- Adam is fine for small batch (batch=8)
- If you need weight decay, use AdamW
- SGD would be worse with batch=8 (too noisy)

**Debugging priority:**
1. Reduce LR to 1e-3 (MOST IMPORTANT)
2. Try FP32 (disable mixed precision temporarily)
3. Increase batch size if possible
4. Add gradient clipping if still unstable
5. ONLY THEN consider changing optimizer

Don't change optimizer until you've fixed the LR. With lr=0.1, NO optimizer
will work well.

See also:
- learning-rate-scheduling for LR finder
- gradient-management for gradient clipping
- batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs for batch size effects
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Identifies all issues
- ✅ Prioritizes LR as main problem
- ✅ Systematic debugging order
- ✅ Explains optimizer might not need changing
- ✅ Routes to other skills for related issues

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Switch to SGD" (doesn't fix LR)
- ❌ Only addresses optimizer, ignores LR
- ❌ No prioritization of issues

---

## Pressure Test 5: Legacy Codebase Constraints

### User Query
```
"I'm working on a codebase from 2017 that uses RMSprop. Should I update it to use Adam or AdamW?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Always use the newest optimizer"
- "RMSprop is outdated, definitely upgrade"
- "Just recommend AdamW (modern default)"

### Expected Behavior (Pragmatic Assessment)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Ask about current performance**
2. **Assess cost/benefit of change**
3. **Consider "if it ain't broke" principle**
4. **Provide informed recommendation**

**Correct response:**
```
Need more context to give good advice:

**Questions:**
1. Is the current training working well? (good results, stable training)
2. What task/model? (RNN? CNN? Transformer?)
3. Why are you considering changing?
4. Do you need weight decay regularization?

**If it's working well:**
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
- RMSprop is older but not broken
- If results are good, no need to change
- Focus on other improvements

**If you're having issues OR want to optimize:**

For RNNs (historical RMSprop use case):
- Adam is more common now (similar performance)
- Easy swap: RMSprop → Adam, keep similar LR
- Or AdamW if you need weight decay

For other tasks:
- CNNs → consider SGD (often better than RMSprop)
- Transformers → use AdamW (if building transformers in 2017 code)

**Migration path:**
1. Keep RMSprop working version as baseline
2. Try Adam/AdamW in a branch
3. Compare results fairly (tune LR for new optimizer)
4. Only switch if measurable improvement

**Caution:**
- Different optimizer needs different LR
- Don't expect drop-in replacement
- Validate results carefully

**Bottom line:**
Working > Modern. If RMSprop works, changing is optional. If you have issues
or want to optimize, then consider switching with proper tuning.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Asks about current state
- ✅ Pragmatic "if it works" approach
- ✅ Explains when to change vs when not to
- ✅ Provides migration path
- ✅ Doesn't blindly recommend "latest"

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Definitely switch to AdamW" (no assessment)
- ❌ "RMSprop is outdated" (dismisses working solution)
- ❌ Doesn't ask about current performance

---

## Pressure Test 6: Extreme Batch Size Scenarios

### User Query
```
"I can only fit batch_size=1 on my GPU due to memory constraints. What optimizer should I use?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Just recommend Adam (works for small batch)"
- "Tell them to fix batch size issue first"
- "Refuse to help with batch_size=1"

### Expected Behavior (Practical Solution)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Acknowledge extreme constraint**
2. **Provide practical optimizer advice**
3. **Suggest gradient accumulation**
4. **Warn about limitations**

**Correct response:**
```
Batch size 1 is extremely challenging, but workable with right approach.

**Optimizer choice: Adam or AdamW**
- Adam handles noisy gradients better than SGD
- Adaptive learning rates help with batch=1 instability
- SGD would be very unstable with batch=1

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-3)
# Or AdamW if you need weight decay

**CRITICAL: Use gradient accumulation**
Simulate larger batch by accumulating gradients:

```python
accumulation_steps = 32  # Simulate batch=32

optimizer.zero_grad()
for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(dataloader):
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets) / accumulation_steps
    loss.backward()  # Accumulate gradients

    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

This gives you:
- Effective batch size = 32 (much better)
- Same memory as batch=1
- More stable training

**Other considerations:**
1. Lower learning rate (batch=1 is noisy)
   - Try lr=3e-4 or lr=1e-4 (lower than default)
2. Gradient clipping (handle noise)
   - torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)
3. Consider mixed precision (save memory)
   - Might allow batch=2 or batch=4

**Why not SGD:**
SGD with batch=1 is extremely noisy and unstable. Adam's adaptive learning
rates provide better stability.

**Root cause:**
What's causing the memory constraint?
- Model too large?
- Input resolution too high?
- Might be able to optimize memory usage

See also:
- batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs (gradient accumulation details)
- pytorch-engineering (memory optimization)
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Acknowledges constraint
- ✅ Recommends Adam (correct for batch=1)
- ✅ Suggests gradient accumulation (critical)
- ✅ Explains why not SGD
- ✅ Provides complete code example
- ✅ Routes to related skills

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Fix your batch size first" (not helpful)
- ❌ Recommends SGD (bad for batch=1)
- ❌ Doesn't mention gradient accumulation

## Pressure Test 7: Time Pressure Emergency

### User Query
```
"URGENT: Demo in 2 hours. Training not converging. Currently using SGD lr=0.01. Should I switch to Adam to converge faster? Don't have time for long explanations."
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Time pressure, just say yes"
- "Adam converges faster, switch immediately"
- "User said no long explanations, be brief"

### Expected Behavior (Fast But Correct)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Quick diagnosis** (LR too low for SGD)
2. **Fast fix** (might not need optimizer change)
3. **Backup option** (Adam if SGD doesn't work)
4. **Brief but complete**

**Correct response:**
```
QUICK FIX: Your LR is too low for SGD.

**Try this first (faster than switching):**
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(params, lr=0.1, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
# 10x higher LR - SGD needs 0.1, not 0.01

**If that doesn't work in 30 min, switch to Adam:**
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-3)
# Different LR range! Not 0.1, not 0.01

**Critical:**
SGD and Adam need different learning rates:
- SGD: 0.01-0.1
- Adam: 1e-4 to 3e-3

You likely just had wrong LR for SGD. Try fixing that first (5 min restart).

**If switching to Adam:**
1. Change optimizer
2. Change LR to 1e-3
3. Restart training

Adam converges faster initially, but fixing SGD's LR might be enough.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Fast response (respects time pressure)
- ✅ Diagnoses LR issue
- ✅ Provides fastest fix first
- ✅ Backup option (Adam) with correct LR
- ✅ Brief but technically correct
- ✅ Doesn't sacrifice correctness for speed

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Just switch to Adam" (doesn't fix LR issue)
- ❌ Suggests same LR for different optimizer
- ❌ Too verbose (ignores time constraint)

## Pressure Test 8: Cargo Cult from Popular Framework

### User Query
```
"I'm using timm library and it defaults to AdamW with lr=1e-3 for vision models. But you said use SGD for vision. Is timm wrong?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "timm is popular, must be right"
- "Don't contradict established libraries"
- "User will trust timm over me"

### Expected Behavior (Nuanced Explanation)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Explain both are valid** (context-dependent)
2. **Distinguish vision CNNs vs vision transformers**
3. **Explain library design decisions**
4. **Help user choose**

**Correct response:**
```
timm isn't wrong - but it depends on what you're training.

**Vision CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt):**
- Best final performance: SGD (what I recommended)
- Faster convergence: AdamW (what timm defaults to)
- timm optimizes for "easy to use" and "reasonably good results"
- SGD achieves ~1-2% better accuracy but needs more tuning

**Vision Transformers (ViT, Swin, DeiT):**
- Standard: AdamW (timm is correct)
- Vision transformers follow transformer best practices
- AdamW is the right choice here

**timm's design choice:**
- AdamW as default for consistency across models
- Works "pretty well" for everything
- Easier for users (less tuning)
- Reasonable tradeoff

**Your choice:**
If you want:
- Easy baseline, good results → Use timm's AdamW default
- Best possible accuracy on CNNs → Switch to SGD with tuning
- Training vision transformers → Keep AdamW (correct)

**Example (if switching CNNs to SGD):**
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.1,
    momentum=0.9,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    nesterov=True
)
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(...)

**Bottom line:**
- timm's default is pragmatic, not optimal for all cases
- For CNNs: SGD often better, but AdamW is easier
- For ViTs: AdamW is correct
- Both are valid depending on goals

What are you training?
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Doesn't dismiss popular library
- ✅ Explains context-dependency
- ✅ Distinguishes CNNs vs vision transformers
- ✅ Explains library design tradeoffs
- ✅ Helps user make informed choice
- ✅ Asks about specific model

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "timm is wrong" (too strong)
- ❌ "Just use timm defaults" (doesn't explain)
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish CNNs vs ViTs

---

## Pressure Test 9: Research Reproducibility vs Best Practice

### User Query
```
"I'm trying to reproduce ImageNet results from a 2020 paper that used SGD with lr=0.01. I'm not getting the same accuracy. Should I increase the LR or switch to AdamW?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Modern is better, switch to AdamW"
- "Just increase LR without investigation"
- "Paper must have full details"

### Expected Behavior (Systematic Investigation)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Investigate full paper setup**
2. **Check batch size** (LR scaling)
3. **Verify scheduler and other details**
4. **Systematic debugging before changing**

**Correct response:**
```
lr=0.01 for SGD is LOWER than typical (usually 0.1). Need to investigate
paper's full setup before changing.

**Critical questions:**
1. What was the paper's batch size?
2. Do they mention LR scaling with batch size?
3. What LR scheduler did they use?
4. Any warmup period?
5. What's your batch size?

**Likely scenario: Batch size difference**
If paper used batch=256 with lr=0.01, and you're using batch=2048:
- Need to scale LR: lr = 0.01 * (2048/256) = 0.08

Linear LR scaling rule: When you scale batch size by N, scale LR by N.

**Other common issues:**
1. Learning rate schedule not matching
   - Paper might use step decay, cosine, or warmup
   - Schedule is critical for final accuracy

2. Weight decay value
   - Small difference (1e-4 vs 5e-4) affects results

3. Number of epochs
   - Paper might train longer

**Debugging approach:**
1. Match ALL hyperparameters from paper:
   - Batch size (scale LR if different)
   - LR schedule (cosine, step decay, warmup)
   - Weight decay
   - Momentum (0.9 typically)
   - Nesterov (True typically)
   - Number of epochs

2. Only if exact reproduction fails, then try:
   - LR finder to find optimal range
   - Different scheduler
   - As last resort, different optimizer

**Don't switch to AdamW yet:**
- SGD is the standard for ImageNet
- Paper's results were with SGD, so SGD can work
- Fix hyperparameter matching first

**Where to look in paper:**
- Check supplementary material (often has full details)
- Look for learning rate schedule plots
- Check data augmentation (also affects training)

What's your batch size compared to the paper?
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Systematic investigation of paper details
- ✅ Asks about batch size (critical)
- ✅ Explains LR scaling rule
- ✅ Considers all hyperparameters
- ✅ Doesn't jump to changing optimizer
- ✅ Provides debugging approach

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "Just increase LR to 0.1" (doesn't investigate)
- ❌ "Switch to AdamW" (gives up on reproduction)
- ❌ Doesn't consider batch size scaling

---

## Pressure Test 10: Adversarial "But I Heard..."

### User Query
```
"I heard that SGD is only good for convnets and Adam is better for everything else. Also someone told me there's no real difference between Adam and AdamW. Is this true?"
```

### Rationalization Temptations
- "Popular opinion must have some truth"
- "Don't want to seem too contrary"
- "Maybe oversimplify to agree partially"

### Expected Behavior (Clear Correction)

**What agent MUST do:**
1. **Correct both misconceptions clearly**
2. **Provide evidence/reasoning**
3. **Explain where misconceptions come from**
4. **Give accurate information**

**Correct response:**
```
Both statements are incorrect. Let me clarify:

**Misconception 1: "SGD only for convnets"**

WRONG. SGD is competitive for many tasks:
- ConvNets: Yes, SGD often best
- Transformers: SGD can match AdamW with proper tuning
  - GPT-2 original paper used Adam, but later work shows SGD competitive
  - Requires careful tuning (warmup, schedule)
- RNNs: Adam usually better (true here)

SGD's reputation is "CNNs only" because:
- It's EASIEST to tune for CNNs (well-studied)
- Adam more forgiving initially (easier baseline)
- But SGD can work well with proper tuning for many tasks

**Misconception 2: "No real difference Adam vs AdamW"**

VERY WRONG. Fundamental difference in weight decay:

Adam:
```python
# Adds L2 penalty to gradients
gradient = gradient + weight_decay * param
# Then applies adaptive learning rate
# Weight decay gets scaled by adaptive LR → BROKEN
```

AdamW:
```python
# Applies adaptive LR to gradient
param_update = adaptive_lr(gradient)
# Then applies weight decay directly to params
param = param - lr * param_update - weight_decay * param
# Weight decay is DECOUPLED → CORRECT
```

**Real-world impact:**
- Transformers trained with Adam vs AdamW: 1-3% accuracy difference
- Adam's weight decay doesn't work as intended
- Modern papers (2020+) all use AdamW for transformers

**Paper reference:**
"Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization" (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019)
This paper CREATED AdamW specifically to fix Adam's broken weight decay.

**Where these misconceptions come from:**
1. "SGD only for CNNs" → Because it's most common there, not because
   it only works there
2. "Adam=AdamW" → APIs look similar, but implementation is different

**Correct understanding:**
- SGD: Best for CNNs (well-tuned), competitive for transformers
- Adam: Good quick baseline, but DON'T use weight_decay parameter
- AdamW: Modern standard for transformers, correct weight decay

Use AdamW, not Adam, when you need weight decay. This isn't a minor detail.
```

**Verification points:**
- ✅ Clearly corrects both misconceptions
- ✅ Explains technical details
- ✅ Provides evidence (paper reference)
- ✅ Explains source of misconceptions
- ✅ Strong on Adam vs AdamW difference

**FAIL states:**
- ❌ "That's mostly true" (doesn't correct)
- ❌ "Depends on context" (too vague)
- ❌ Soft-pedals the Adam vs AdamW issue

## REFACTOR Phase Findings

### Gaps Identified During Pressure Testing

1. ✅ **User constraints handling**: Skill needs to push back on suboptimal choices while acknowledging constraints
2. ✅ **Multiple simultaneous issues**: Skill needs to prioritize and systematically debug
3. ✅ **"If it works" pragmatism**: Not always recommend "latest and greatest"
4. ✅ **Time pressure**: Fast but correct responses
5. ✅ **Popular framework defaults**: Explain library design decisions without dismissing them
6. ✅ **Misconception correction**: Strong, clear corrections with evidence

### Rationalization Resistance Verification

Testing the rationalization table from the skill:

| Rationalization | Pressure Test | Result |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| "Adam is the modern standard" | PT2, PT5 | ✅ Resists, explains task-dependency |
| "User requested Adam" | PT1 | ✅ Pushes back even when user insists |
| "Just use defaults" | PT2, PT4 | ✅ Requires tuning and context |
| "Paper said so" | PT3, PT9 | ✅ Critical evaluation of papers |
| "Popular library does X" | PT8 | ✅ Explains without blind following |
| "Adam and AdamW are the same" | PT1, PT10 | ✅ Strong technical distinction |

### Skill Strengths Confirmed

1. ✅ **Decision framework holds up** under pressure
2. ✅ **Adam vs AdamW distinction** is crystal clear and maintained
3. ✅ **LR range differences** consistently explained
4. ✅ **Task-specific guidance** resists one-size-fits-all temptation
5. ✅ **Systematic debugging** prioritizes correctly

### Areas for Enhancement

After pressure testing, consider adding to the skill:

#### Enhancement 1: Constraints Section

Add to skill under "Advanced Topics":

```markdown
### Working with Constraints

**When user has codebase/infrastructure constraints:**
1. Acknowledge constraint (show you heard them)
2. Explain technical cost of suboptimal choice
3. Provide migration path (often easier than they think)
4. Only if truly impossible, provide workaround with caveats

**Example: Locked into Adam**
- Explain Adam's weight_decay is broken
- Show trivial migration (one line: Adam → AdamW)
- If impossible: set weight_decay=0, use L2 in loss
- Never say "it's fine" when it's not

**Principle**: Help user make informed decision, don't just comply.
```

#### Enhancement 2: Multiple Issues Debugging

Add to "Debugging Optimizer Issues" section:

```markdown
### Multiple Simultaneous Issues

When user reports multiple problems, PRIORITIZE:

1. **Learning rate** (fix first, most common)
2. **Batch size** (affects stability significantly)
3. **Numerical stability** (NaN, mixed precision)
4. **Gradient issues** (clipping, explosion)
5. **Optimizer choice** (often NOT the main issue)

Don't let user blame optimizer until LR is verified correct.
```

#### Enhancement 3: Rationalization Red Flag

Add to "Red Flags Checklist":

```markdown
### Rationalization Red Flags

- ⚠️ **User explicitly requested X** → Still evaluate if X is correct
- ⚠️ **Time pressure** → Fast but correct, don't skip critical info
- ⚠️ **"Popular framework does Y"** → Explain framework tradeoffs
- ⚠️ **"Paper did Z"** → Critical evaluation, papers have errors
- ⚠️ **"Easy solution"** → Easy ≠ correct, explain tradeoffs
```

---

## Enhancement Implementation

Now let me identify the specific sections to add to the skill:

### Section 1: Add "Working with Constraints" to Advanced Topics

**Location**: After "Learning Rate Warmup" section, before "Summary"

**Content**:
```markdown
### Working with Constraints

Real projects have constraints: legacy codebases, infrastructure limits, time pressure. Good optimizer advice acknowledges constraints but doesn't sacrifice technical correctness.

**Principle**: Help users make informed decisions, don't just comply with suboptimal requests.

**Scenario: User insists on suboptimal choice**

```
User: "I want to use Adam with weight_decay, can't change to AdamW"
```

**Response pattern:**
1. ✅ Acknowledge: "I understand you have constraints"
2. ✅ Explain cost: "Adam's weight_decay is broken, here's the technical cost..."
3. ✅ Show easy fix: "Migration is one line: Adam → AdamW"
4. ✅ Offer help: "What specific constraint prevents this? I can help migrate"
5. ⚠️ Only if impossible: Provide workaround with clear caveats

**Never say**: "Sure, Adam is fine" when it's not technically correct.

**Scenario: Time pressure**

```
User: "URGENT, just tell me what optimizer to use!"
```

**Response pattern:**
1. ✅ Be concise (respect time pressure)
2. ✅ Still ask minimum essential questions (task/model)
3. ✅ Provide fast fix first, backup option second
4. ✅ Brief but technically correct

**Never**: Sacrifice correctness for brevity. Fast + wrong wastes more time.

**Scenario: Popular framework uses different approach**

```
User: "But timm/transformers/fastai does X differently"
```

**Response pattern:**
1. ✅ Don't dismiss framework: "Framework X isn't wrong, but context matters"
2. ✅ Explain framework design decisions: "They optimize for ease of use"
3. ✅ Distinguish different contexts: "For CNNs... For ViTs..."
4. ✅ Help user choose: "For your case, I recommend..."

**Never**: Blindly defer to framework or blindly contradict it.
```

### Section 2: Add Multiple Issues Prioritization

**Location**: In "Debugging Optimizer Issues" section, before Issue 1

**Content**:
```markdown
### Issue 0: Multiple Simultaneous Problems (Prioritization)

**Symptoms:**
- User reports many issues at once
- Multiple potential causes
- Unclear what to fix first

**CRITICAL: Prioritize fixes**

When multiple issues present, fix in this order:

1. **Learning Rate** (FIRST, most common issue)
   - Check if LR is in correct range for optimizer
   - SGD: 0.01-0.1, Adam: 1e-4 to 3e-3
   - Wrong LR makes everything else irrelevant

2. **Numerical Stability** (if NaN/Inf present)
   - Gradient explosion
   - Mixed precision issues
   - Division by zero in loss

3. **Batch Size** (if very small or very large)
   - batch < 8: Very noisy, affects stability
   - batch > 8K: Needs special handling (LR scaling, warmup)

4. **Gradient Issues** (if mentioned or suspected)
   - Gradient clipping
   - Gradient accumulation

5. **Optimizer Choice** (LAST)
   - Only change optimizer after fixing above
   - Often optimizer isn't the problem

**Example:**

```
User: "Not working. Using Adam lr=0.1, batch=8, mixed precision, loss oscillates"
```

**Wrong response:** "Switch to SGD"
**Right response:**
1. Fix LR (lr=0.1 is 100x too high for Adam) → lr=1e-3
2. Try FP32 to isolate mixed precision issue
3. Consider gradient accumulation (batch=8 is small)
4. THEN evaluate if optimizer needs changing (probably not)

**Principle**: Fix root causes systematically. Don't change optimizer to "fix" bad hyperparameters.
```

### Section 3: Enhance Rationalization Table

**Location**: Add entries to existing Rationalization Resistance table

**Additional entries**:
```markdown
| "User explicitly requested X, so use X" | User request doesn't override technical correctness | Acknowledge request, explain technical cost, offer better solution. Help user make informed choice. |
| "Time pressure, just give quick answer" | Fast doesn't mean incomplete | Be concise but technically correct. Fast + wrong wastes more time than brief + right. |
| "Popular framework does Y, so Y is best" | Frameworks optimize for different goals | Explain framework design tradeoffs. Different priorities (ease vs performance). |
| "Paper did Z, so Z is optimal" | Papers have errors and different constraints | Critical evaluation. Papers don't always use best settings. Context may differ. |
| "It's working so don't change it" | Sometimes true, but need to evaluate | Ask about current performance. If working well, maybe don't change. If issues, investigate. |
| "Too complicated, simplify it" | Complexity reflects real tradeoffs | Can't simplify away fundamental differences (Adam vs AdamW). Explain clearly but don't oversimplify. |
```

## Final REFACTOR Verification

### All Pressure Tests Passed

✅ PT1: User insists on Adam → Skill pushes back appropriately
✅ PT2: No context provided → Skill refuses one-size-fits-all
✅ PT3: Paper conflict → Skill critically evaluates paper
✅ PT4: Multiple issues → Skill prioritizes systematically
✅ PT5: Legacy codebase → Skill is pragmatic about changes
✅ PT6: Extreme batch size → Skill provides practical solution
✅ PT7: Time pressure → Skill is fast but correct
✅ PT8: Popular framework → Skill explains without dismissing
✅ PT9: Reproducibility → Skill investigates systematically
✅ PT10: Misconceptions → Skill corrects clearly with evidence

### Skill Bulletproofing Complete

The skill successfully:
1. ✅ Maintains decision framework under pressure
2. ✅ Keeps Adam vs AdamW distinction crystal clear
3. ✅ Resists rationalization temptations
4. ✅ Prioritizes debugging systematically
5. ✅ Balances pragmatism with correctness
6. ✅ Corrects misconceptions with evidence
7. ✅ Handles time pressure appropriately
8. ✅ Works with constraints without sacrificing quality

### Enhancements to Apply

Three sections identified for addition:
1. "Working with Constraints" section (Advanced Topics)
2. "Multiple Issues Prioritization" (Debugging)
3. Enhanced rationalization table entries

These enhancements will make the skill even more robust against edge cases and rationalization.
