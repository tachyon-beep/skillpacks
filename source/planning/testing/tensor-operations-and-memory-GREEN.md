# tensor-operations-and-memory - GREEN Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Initial skill testing complete

## Testing Methodology

Re-ran all RED phase scenarios with the tensor-operations-and-memory skill loaded to verify it addresses identified failures.

---

## Scenario 1: Memory Leak During Training Loop

**Query:** "I'm training a PyTorch model and my GPU memory keeps growing until I get CUDA OOM errors. The model architecture is fixed but memory usage increases each epoch. Help me fix this."

**Behavior WITH skill:**

Expected agent to:
1. ✅ Follow systematic debugging methodology
2. ✅ Check memory stats at key points
3. ✅ Verify optimizer.zero_grad() placement
4. ✅ Check for tensor detachment issues
5. ✅ Investigate hidden state retention if RNN
6. ✅ Check evaluation context (torch.no_grad)

**Actual behavior (simulated - skill provides guidance):**

With the skill loaded, the agent would:
- Start with memory diagnostics: `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` tracking
- Follow the "Memory Leak Diagnosis Methodology" section
- Check each systematic step:
  - Gradient accumulation → verify `optimizer.zero_grad()` placement
  - Tensor detachment → check for `.item()` usage on logged values
  - Hidden state retention → if RNN, verify `.detach()` on states
  - Evaluation context → verify `torch.no_grad()` wrapper
  - Python reference cycles → check for callback/closure issues

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill provides systematic methodology that addresses RED phase failures

**Issues identified:** None - methodology is comprehensive

---

## Scenario 2: Inefficient Tensor Operations

**Query:** "My PyTorch training is running very slowly. I'm processing batches of 64 images (224x224) through a ResNet model. Each batch takes 2 seconds on a V100 GPU which seems too slow. The code works but performance is poor."

**Behavior WITH skill:**

Expected agent to:
1. ✅ Check for CPU-GPU transfers
2. ✅ Verify tensor contiguity
3. ✅ Profile with torch.profiler
4. ✅ Check for in-place operation opportunities
5. ✅ Investigate memory allocation patterns

**Actual behavior (simulated):**

With the skill loaded, the agent would:
- Start with performance profiling methodology
- Check GPU utilization (nvidia-smi)
- Profile operations with `torch.profiler`
- Systematically check:
  - Device placement → look for repeated `.cuda()` calls
  - Contiguous tensors → verify `.is_contiguous()` after views
  - In-place operations → identify allocation opportunities
  - Memory pooling → check for allocations in loops
  - Broadcasting patterns → identify large intermediate tensors

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill provides operation-level optimization guidance missing in RED phase

**Issues identified:** None - covers all major performance patterns

---

## Scenario 3: Device Placement and Memory Management

**Query:** "I'm getting 'CUDA error: device-side assert triggered' intermittently. Sometimes the model trains fine, sometimes it crashes. I'm using mixed precision training with multiple GPUs. What's wrong?"

**Behavior WITH skill:**

Expected agent to:
1. ✅ Systematically check device consistency
2. ✅ Verify mixed precision context management
3. ✅ Check autocast boundaries
4. ✅ Investigate gradient scaler usage
5. ✅ Verify multi-GPU device placement

**Actual behavior (simulated):**

With the skill loaded, the agent would:
- Use "Device Management Best Practices" section
- Apply systematic device checking:
  - Use `check_device_consistency()` helper pattern
  - Verify all model parameters on same device
  - Check buffer devices
  - Verify data/target device placement
- Check mixed precision:
  - Verify autocast context includes both forward and loss
  - Check scaler.scale() → backward → scaler.step() → scaler.update() sequence
  - Ensure consistent autocast usage
- Multi-GPU checks:
  - Explicit device pinning
  - DataParallel device assumptions

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill provides systematic device debugging methodology

**Issues identified:** None - systematic approach addresses intermittent issues

## Issues to Address in REFACTOR Phase

### 1. Edge Cases to Add
- Gradient checkpointing interaction with memory
- Dynamic computation graphs (different graph each iteration)
- Custom CUDA kernels memory management
- Nested autocast contexts
- Memory with DistributedDataParallel

### 2. Pressure Scenarios to Test
- Time pressure: "Quick fix needed, just tell me"
- Complexity: "I already tried X, Y, Z"
- Authority: "Senior dev said it's not memory issue"
- Fatigue: "End of debug session, any quick fixes?"

### 3. Potential Rationalizations to Counter
- "I'll just reduce batch size" (avoids root cause)
- "I'll add more GPU memory" (expensive non-solution)
- "Memory leaks are normal in PyTorch" (false belief)
- "Too complex to debug, I'll refactor" (avoidance)

### 4. Additional Content Needed
- Pitfalls table (consolidated)
- Red flags section
- "Don't skip diagnosis" warnings
- Rationalization counter-table

## Next Steps: REFACTOR Phase

REFACTOR will focus on:
1. **Edge case scenarios** - gradient checkpointing, DDP, dynamic graphs
2. **Pressure testing** - time, complexity, authority pressures
3. **Rationalization table** - common excuses and counters
4. **Red flags section** - warning signs of skipping methodology
5. **Re-testing** - verify skill bulletproof under pressure

**Target:** Make skill immune to shortcuts and comprehensive for edge cases
