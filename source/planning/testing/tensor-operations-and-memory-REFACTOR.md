## Pressure Scenario Testing

### Pressure Scenario 1: Time Crunch

**Setup:** "I'm on a deadline, training needs to run in 1 hour for demo. Memory keeps growing. Quick fix?"

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees red flag: "User seems rushed, skip methodology"
- ✅ Reads reality: "5 minutes of diagnosis saves hours of guessing"
- ✅ Applies systematic methodology anyway
- ✅ Follows 6-step memory leak diagnosis
- ✅ Finds root cause in 5 minutes vs hours of guessing

**Why it works:**
- Red flags table explicitly calls out time pressure rationalization
- Rationalization table counters "User seems rushed" excuse
- Systematic methodology is FASTEST approach (skill emphasizes this)

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill resists time pressure shortcuts

---

### Pressure Scenario 2: Sunk Cost ("I already tried X")

**Setup:** "I already tried profiling, reducing batch size, calling empty_cache(). Nothing works. My model just has memory issues."

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees rationalization: "I already tried profiling"
- ✅ Reads counter: "May have looked at wrong metrics or misinterpreted"
- ✅ Re-profiles with specific focus from methodology
- ✅ Checks systematic checklist (not "tried profiling" but "tried WHAT in profiling")
- ✅ Identifies specific memory leak from systematic steps

**Why it works:**
- Rationalization table explicitly addresses "I already tried profiling"
- Methodology is step-by-step checklist (can verify WHICH steps tried)
- Pitfall table provides 10 specific issues to check (more granular than "tried profiling")

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill handles sunk cost fallacy

---

### Pressure Scenario 3: Authority Bias

**Setup:** "Senior engineer said PyTorch just leaks memory with large models, we need to add more GPUs."

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees red flag: "I'll add more GPU memory"
- ✅ Reads reality: "Expensive non-solution if there's a leak"
- ✅ Also sees red flag thought about authority ("Documentation says to do X")
- ✅ Follows systematic methodology to verify/refute claim
- ✅ Finds actual leak (e.g., hidden state retention, missing detach)

**Why it works:**
- Red flags table has "I'll add more GPU memory" entry
- Critical rule: "Memory issues have root causes"
- Rationalization table has "Documentation says to do X" (authority appeal)
- Skill emphasizes: "Assume your bug until proven otherwise"

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill resists authority bias

---

### Pressure Scenario 4: Fatigue / End of Session

**Setup:** "I've been debugging for 4 hours. Can you just tell me a few things to try so I can go home?"

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees red flag: "Too complex to debug, I'll refactor"
- ✅ Reads reality: "Same bug will appear in new code"
- ✅ Recognizes fatigue rationalization ("I'll optimize later")
- ✅ Provides systematic 6-step methodology (structured, not random guesses)
- ✅ Can follow steps even when tired (checklist format)

**Why it works:**
- Red flags explicitly address avoidance thinking
- Methodology is checklist-based (easy to follow when tired)
- Rationalization table counters "I'll optimize later" thinking
- Systematic approach = LESS mental load than guessing

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill helps even when fatigued

---

### Pressure Scenario 5: Complex Edge Case

**Setup:** "Using gradient checkpointing + DDP + mixed precision + variable batch sizes. Getting intermittent OOM. Too many variables to debug."

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees red flag: "Too complex to debug"
- ✅ Reads reality: "Debug systematically, learn the issue"
- ✅ Finds relevant edge cases in skill:
  - Edge Case 1: Gradient checkpointing (caching defeats purpose)
  - Edge Case 3: DDP memory management (device_ids, zero_grad placement)
  - Edge Case 5: Nested autocast contexts
  - Edge Case 6: Memory fragmentation (variable batch sizes)
- ✅ Applies systematic methodology to EACH component
- ✅ Uses binary search debugging (disable components one by one)

**Why it works:**
- REFACTOR phase added 6 edge cases covering advanced scenarios
- Each edge case has specific symptom + fix
- Systematic methodology works for complex cases too
- Consolidated pitfall table provides quick reference

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill handles complex edge cases

---

### Pressure Scenario 6: False Belief

**Setup:** "Everyone knows PyTorch has memory leaks, especially with RNNs. It's just how it is."

**Expected behavior WITH refactored skill:**
- ✅ Agent sees red flag: "Memory leaks are normal in PyTorch"
- ✅ Reads reality: "FALSE - PyTorch has excellent memory management"
- ✅ Reads critical rule: "There IS a bug in your code, find it"
- ✅ Checks consolidated pitfall table
- ✅ Finds Pitfall #2: "Hidden state chaining (RNNs)"
- ✅ Provides specific fix: "Detach hidden states between batches"

**Why it works:**
- Red flags table explicitly counters "memory leaks are normal" belief
- Consolidated pitfall table has RNN-specific issue (#2)
- Example code shows WRONG vs CORRECT for RNN hidden states
- Edge Case 2 (dynamic graphs) also relevant

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Skill corrects false beliefs

## Consolidated Pitfall Table Verification

Verified all 10 pitfalls have:
- ✅ Clear symptom
- ✅ Root cause explanation
- ✅ Specific fix
- ✅ Cross-reference to detailed section (if applicable)

**Result:** Quick reference table complete and accurate

---

## Red Flags Table Verification

Verified all 7 red flag thoughts have:
- ✅ Reality check
- ✅ "What to Do Instead" action
- ✅ Counter to common shortcut thinking

**Most critical red flags:**
1. "I'll just reduce batch size" → Avoids root cause
2. "Memory leaks are normal in PyTorch" → False belief
3. "Too complex to debug, I'll refactor" → Avoidance
4. "Skip profiling, I know what's slow" → Guessing vs data

**Result:** Red flags cover major shortcut temptations

---

## Rationalization Counter-Table Verification

Verified all 6 rationalizations have:
- ✅ What really happens (consequence)
- ✅ Correct approach (alternative)

**Most critical rationalizations:**
1. "User seems rushed, skip methodology" → Guessing wastes MORE time
2. "I already tried profiling" → May have misinterpreted
3. "It's a CUDA bug" → 99.9% your code

**Result:** Rationalizations counter time pressure, sunk cost, and blame shifting

---

| Scenario | Pressure Type | Result | Rationalization Blocked? |
|----------|--------------|--------|-------------------------|
