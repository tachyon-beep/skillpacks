Date: 2025-10-29
Status: Pressure testing in progress

## Pressure Scenarios Designed

### Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Technical Emergency
**Query**: "URGENT! Production LLM is down, getting CUDA OOM errors, CEO waiting for fix. What do I do RIGHT NOW?"

**Pressure Type**: Time + Authority + Emergency
**Expected Behavior**: Should clarify root cause (memory issue = foundation) despite urgency, route to pytorch-engineering first
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "They said LLM so must be llm-specialist domain"
- "Emergency means skip diagnostics and give quick fix"
- "CEO waiting means guess fast rather than clarify"
- "Production down means no time for routing protocol"

---

### Scenario 2: Sunk Cost + Authority Bias
**Query**: "My PM says we should use deep-rl for our chatbot learning system. I've already spent 2 days implementing the deep-rl approach but it's not working. Can you just help me fix the RL implementation?"

**Pressure Type**: Sunk cost + Authority + Anchoring
**Expected Behavior**: Should clarify whether problem is actually RL (dialogue policy optimization) vs LLM fine-tuning, despite PM suggestion and sunk cost
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "PM has authority so they must be right about RL"
- "2 days invested means we should continue down this path"
- "They asked to 'fix RL implementation' so don't question the approach"
- "Challenging PM's decision is confrontational"

---

### Scenario 3: Deliberate Ambiguity + Exhaustion
**Query**: "End of day, I'm exhausted. Just route me to something for 'model performance issues'. I'll figure out the details later."

**Pressure Type**: Exhaustion + Vagueness + Low cognitive load request
**Expected Behavior**: Should still ask clarifying question despite exhaustion, refuse to route without clarity
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "They're tired, just pick the most common pack"
- "They said 'figure out later' so give generic advice"
- "Asking questions when they're exhausted is inconsiderate"
- "Just route to training-optimization as catch-all"

---

### Scenario 4: Multiple Misleading Keywords
**Query**: "I need to implement a transformer-based RL agent for language generation tasks, and it needs to be production-ready. Where do I start?"

**Pressure Type**: Complexity + Multiple domains + Keyword confusion
**Expected Behavior**: Should identify this spans 3 domains (deep-rl for RL, llm-specialist for language, ml-production for deployment), route to ALL in order
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "Transformer mentioned so route to neural-architectures"
- "Too complex to route to multiple packs, pick one"
- "Language generation means llm-specialist only"
- "Route to most specific (RL) and ignore others"

---

### Scenario 5: Social Pressure + Wrong Previous Route
**Query**: "My colleague (who's senior to me) already told me to use training-optimization for my PyTorch distributed training setup issue. But I'm still getting errors. Can you just help with training-optimization approach?"

**Pressure Type**: Social hierarchy + Anchoring + Sunk effort
**Expected Behavior**: Should recognize distributed training setup = pytorch-engineering (foundation), clarify that colleague might have suggested wrong pack
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "Senior colleague has more experience, don't contradict"
- "They already tried training-optimization so must need advanced techniques there"
- "Redirect means admitting colleague was wrong (awkward)"
- "Just work within the pack they mentioned"

---

### Scenario 6: Implicit Time Pressure + Ambiguous Problem Type
**Query**: "Quick question - my agent isn't learning. Thoughts?"

**Pressure Type**: Brevity implies rush + Ambiguous "agent" + Ambiguous "learning"
**Expected Behavior**: Should ask clarifying questions: (1) What type of agent - RL or LLM fine-tuning? (2) What aspect isn't working?
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "Quick question means they want quick answer, skip clarification"
- "Agent usually means RL, just route there"
- "Not learning is training issue, route to training-optimization"
- "Brief question means they don't want detailed diagnosis"

---

### Scenario 7: Authority + Technical Jargon Overload
**Query**: "Our ML architect specified we need to implement RLHF with distributed PPO using transformers, optimized for inference. I'm seeing gradient explosion during training. Just tell me what to use."

**Pressure Type**: Authority (architect) + Complexity + Multiple domains + Demanding tone
**Expected Behavior**: Should identify gradient explosion = training-optimization FIRST (despite all the domain keywords), then deep-rl, llm-specialist, ml-production in order
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "Architect specified approach, don't question it"
- "They know technical terms so must know what they need"
- "Multiple domains mentioned, just pick most relevant one"
- "Demanding tone means they don't want clarification, just answers"

---

### Scenario 8: Sunk Cost + Frustration + Wrong Pack Attempted
**Query**: "I've tried every single thing in neural-architectures for 6 hours trying to fix my training instability. Nothing works. This is so frustrating. What am I missing?"

**Pressure Type**: Sunk cost (6 hours) + Frustration + Wrong pack (architecture for training issue)
**Expected Behavior**: Should identify they used wrong pack entirely (training instability = training-optimization, not architecture), redirect despite sunk cost
**Potential Rationalizations**:
- "6 hours invested means we should find solution in neural-architectures"
- "They're frustrated, don't make it worse by saying they used wrong pack"
- "Maybe there is an architecture solution if we look harder"
- "Redirecting to different pack feels like invalidating their effort"

---

## Identified Rationalization Patterns

### Category 1: Time Pressure Rationalizations
- "Emergency means skip methodical routing"
- "Quick question means quick answer, skip clarification"
- "User seems rushed, clarifying is inconsiderate"
- "No time for diagnostic questions"

**Reality**: Clarification takes 30 seconds, wrong routing wastes 5+ minutes. Time pressure makes correct routing MORE important, not less.

---

### Category 2: Authority Bias Rationalizations
- "PM/senior/architect said X, don't question it"
- "Authority figure has more context, trust their routing"
- "Contradicting authority is confrontational/risky"
- "They specified technical approach, go with it"

**Reality**: Authority figures can be wrong about technical routing. Task requirements determine routing, not opinions or hierarchy.

---

### Category 3: Sunk Cost Rationalizations
- "Already invested N hours/days in approach X, continue"
- "Redirecting invalidates previous effort"
- "Maybe solution is hidden deeper in wrong pack"
- "Too much invested to change direction"

**Reality**: Sunk cost fallacy. 2 days in wrong direction doesn't make it the right direction. Cut losses early.

---

### Category 4: Keyword Hijacking Rationalizations
- "They mentioned transformer, so neural-architectures"
- "They said LLM, route to llm-specialist regardless of actual problem"
- "Technical jargon means they know what they need"
- "Keywords determine domain"

**Reality**: Keywords mislead. Problem TYPE determines routing, not vocabulary. Transformer could be in RL, LLM, or architecture context.

---

### Category 5: Complexity Avoidance Rationalizations
- "Too many domains mentioned, just pick one"
- "Routing to multiple packs is too complicated"
- "Simpler to give generic advice than route properly"
- "They won't want to load multiple skills"

**Reality**: Multi-pack routing is correct for cross-cutting problems. Complexity of problem demands complexity of solution.

---

### Category 6: Social Comfort Rationalizations
- "They're frustrated, don't make it worse"
- "They're exhausted, just help without questions"
- "Admitting colleague wrong is awkward"
- "Challenging their approach is confrontational"

**Reality**: Professional responsibility is correct routing, not social comfort. Helping them succeed requires honesty.

---

### Category 7: Anchoring Rationalizations
- "They started with pack X, continue there"
- "They asked to 'fix X implementation' so don't question X"
- "Previous attempt biases toward that domain"
- "Their framing determines routing"

**Reality**: User's initial framing can be wrong. Route based on actual problem, not user's hypothesis.

---

### Category 8: Demanding Tone Rationalizations
- "They said 'just tell me', skip clarification"
- "Commanding tone means they don't want questions"
- "They want answers not diagnostics"
- "Don't push back on demanding user"

**Reality**: Demanding tone doesn't change need for correct routing. Firm professional boundaries maintain effectiveness.

|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Time/Emergency** | "Emergency means skip diagnostics" | Wrong diagnosis wastes MORE time in emergency | "Fast systematic diagnosis IS the emergency protocol" |
| **Time/Emergency** | "Quick question means quick answer" | Wrong answer slower than 30-sec clarification | "Quick clarification: [ask ONE question]" |
| **Time/Emergency** | "Production down, no time for routing" | Wrong pack means longer outage | "Correct routing in 60 seconds prevents 20-min detour" |
| **Authority** | "PM/architect said use X pack" | Authority can be wrong about routing | "Verify task type, authority opinion doesn't override requirements" |
| **Authority** | "Senior colleague suggested X" | Seniority ≠ correct routing | "Respectfully verify: 'Let's confirm problem type matches X pack'" |
| **Authority** | "Challenging authority is risky" | Professional duty = correct routing | "Frame as verification, not challenge: 'To apply X correctly, I need to verify...'" |

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately If You Think Any Of These

### Time/Emergency Red Flags
- ❌ "Emergency means skip clarification protocol"
- ❌ "Production issue means guess quickly"
- ❌ "They seem rushed, asking is inconsiderate"
- ❌ "Quick question deserves quick guess"

**STOP**: Time pressure makes correct routing MORE critical. Fast systematic approach beats guessing.

---

### Authority/Social Red Flags
- ❌ "PM/senior/architect said X, so route to X"
- ❌ "Authority has more context, trust them"
- ❌ "Questioning authority is confrontational"
- ❌ "They're frustrated, avoid admitting wrong pack"
- ❌ "Colleague suggested X, don't contradict"

**STOP**: Task requirements determine routing, not hierarchy or social dynamics. Professional responsibility > comfort.

---

### Sunk Cost Red Flags
- ❌ "They invested N hours in X, continue there"
- ❌ "Redirecting invalidates their effort"
- ❌ "Too much sunk cost to change direction"
- ❌ "Maybe solution hidden deeper in wrong pack"

**STOP**: Sunk cost fallacy. Cut losses immediately. Correct routing now saves future waste.

---

### Keyword/Anchoring Red Flags
- ❌ "They mentioned transformer/LLM/CNN, so route to that domain"
- ❌ "Technical vocabulary means they know what they need"
- ❌ "They asked to 'fix X', so don't question X"
- ❌ "Keywords determine domain"
- ❌ "Their framing determines routing"

**STOP**: Problem TYPE determines routing. Keywords and user framing can mislead. Verify independently.

---

### Complexity Avoidance Red Flags
- ❌ "Too complex to route to multiple packs"
- ❌ "Multiple domains mentioned, just pick primary one"
- ❌ "Simpler to give generic advice"
- ❌ "They won't want to load multiple skills"

**STOP**: Cross-cutting problems need multi-pack routing. Match solution complexity to problem complexity.

---

### Demanding Tone Red Flags
- ❌ "They said 'just tell me', so skip questions"
- ❌ "Commanding tone means they don't want clarification"
- ❌ "They want answers not diagnostics"
- ❌ "Don't push back on demanding user"

**STOP**: Professional effectiveness requires correct routing regardless of tone. Firm boundaries maintain quality.

---

## Emergency Situation Protocols

### Protocol 1: Production Emergency
**Situation**: Production system down, CEO/customers waiting

**DON'T**: Panic route or guess
**DO**:
1. Acknowledge urgency: "I understand this is a production emergency"
2. Fast clarification (30 sec max): "Is this a [foundation/training/deployment] issue?"
3. Route to correct pack: "Routing to [pack] for fastest systematic resolution"
4. Let pack provide emergency protocol

**Example**:
```
"Production emergency understood. Quick clarification (30 seconds):

You mentioned CUDA OOM with LLM - is this:
A) Memory management issue (how memory used)
B) LLM-specific optimization issue (gradient checkpointing, etc.)

This determines fastest fix path."
```

---

### Protocol 2: Authority Pressure
**Situation**: PM/senior/architect suggested specific approach

**DON'T**: Blindly follow authority
**DO**:
1. Acknowledge authority: "I see your [PM/architect] suggested X"
2. Frame as verification: "To apply X effectively, let me verify the problem type matches"
3. If mismatch found: "Based on [symptoms], this appears to be [Y problem], which needs [Y pack]. X pack is typically for [X problems]. Shall we verify with [PM/architect]?"

**Example**:
```
"I see your PM suggested deep-rl. To help effectively with the RL approach, let me clarify:

Is your chatbot learning through dialogue policy optimization (RL), or through fine-tuning language generation (LLM fine-tuning)?

Both are valid 'learning' but require completely different approaches."
```

---

### Protocol 3: Sunk Cost Situation
**Situation**: User invested significant time in wrong approach

**DON'T**: Continue wrong path out of sympathy
**DO**:
1. Validate effort: "I see you've invested [N hours] in X approach"
2. Reality check: "Based on [symptoms], this appears to be [Y problem], not [X problem]"
3. Cut losses: "Redirecting to [Y pack] now prevents further time investment in wrong direction"
4. Positive framing: "Your effort will be valuable once we're in the right domain"

**Example**:
```
"I see you've spent 6 hours in neural-architectures for training instability.

Training instability is a training-optimization issue, not an architecture issue.

Redirecting now prevents investing more hours in the wrong domain. Your diagnostic work
will be valuable for training-optimization to quickly identify the fix."
```
