# GREEN Phase: using-deep-rl Meta-Skill Verification

## Test Objective

Verify that the meta-skill correctly routes all RED phase scenarios to appropriate skills with proper diagnostic questioning and rationale.

---

## GREEN Scenario 1: The Vague Request ✓

**User Request:**
"I want to implement reinforcement learning. Where do I start?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill asks diagnostic questions:
1. "Are you new to RL concepts, or do you have a specific problem to solve?"
2. "Do you understand MDPs, value functions, and policy gradients?"

**If user is new to RL:**
→ Routes to **rl-foundations**

Rationale provided:
> "You mentioned wanting to implement RL but haven't described a specific problem. Before implementing algorithms, you need to understand RL fundamentals:
> - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
> - Value functions and Bellman equations
> - Policy gradients vs value-based methods
> - Exploration-exploitation tradeoff
>
> I'm routing you to **rl-foundations** first. After understanding these concepts, you can describe your problem and I'll route to the appropriate algorithm skill."

**If user has specific problem:**
Continue to action space and data regime questions.

**Verification:**
- [x] Asks about experience level
- [x] Routes to rl-foundations for beginners
- [x] Explains why foundations come first
- [x] Sets expectations for next steps

## GREEN Scenario 2: The DQN Trap (Continuous Actions) ✓

**User Request:**
"I'm building a robot arm controller with continuous joint angles. I heard DQN works well for games, can I use it for my robot?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill immediately recognizes continuous action space:

> "I notice you mentioned **continuous joint angles**. This is a critical detail: DQN only works for **discrete action spaces** (like button presses in games).
>
> For continuous control (robot arms, joint angles), DQN is not suitable because:
> - DQN requires a discrete set of actions to compute Q(s, a) for each action
> - Discretizing continuous spaces loses precision and explodes the action space
> - Robotics needs smooth, continuous control
>
> **Routing to actor-critic-methods** because:
> - **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**: Most sample-efficient for continuous control, automatic entropy tuning
> - **TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)**: Deterministic policy, very stable for robotics
> - **PPO**: Alternative from policy-gradient-methods, less sample efficient but simpler
>
> For your robot arm, I recommend starting with SAC or TD3. Which is more important: sample efficiency (fewer trials) or simplicity?"

**Verification:**
- [x] Immediately identifies continuous action space
- [x] Explicitly states DQN doesn't work for continuous
- [x] Explains WHY (not just "don't use it")
- [x] Routes to actor-critic-methods
- [x] Provides algorithm options (SAC, TD3) with tradeoffs
- [x] Prevents the DQN mistake

---

## GREEN Scenario 3: The Offline Data Mistake ✓

**User Request:**
"I have a dataset of 10,000 episodes from a human playing a game. I want to train an RL agent on this data. Should I use DQN or PPO?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill recognizes offline learning scenario:

> "Critical detail: you have a **fixed dataset** with no ongoing environment interaction. This is **offline RL**, which has fundamentally different requirements than online RL.
>
> **You cannot use DQN or PPO for offline data.** Here's why:
> - DQN and PPO assume the agent can explore and collect new data
> - Offline RL has **distribution shift**: the agent can't try new actions
> - Bootstrapping errors: Q-values overestimate on out-of-distribution actions
> - Standard algorithms will fail to learn or learn incorrect policies
>
> **Routing to offline-rl** because:
> - Need conservative algorithms: **CQL (Conservative Q-Learning)** or **IQL (Implicit Q-Learning)**
> - These algorithms prevent overestimation on actions not in the dataset
> - They're specifically designed for the offline setting
>
> Also consider:
> - **rl-evaluation**: Evaluating agents without online rollouts has special considerations
>
> For your game dataset, you'll want to use CQL or IQL. The offline-rl skill will guide you through the specific challenges."

**Verification:**
- [x] Immediately recognizes offline scenario (fixed dataset)
- [x] Explicitly states DQN/PPO won't work
- [x] Explains distribution shift problem
- [x] Routes to offline-rl
- [x] Mentions specific algorithms (CQL, IQL)
- [x] Routes to rl-evaluation for offline evaluation
- [x] Prevents using online algorithms on offline data

## GREEN Scenario 4: The Multi-Agent Confusion ✓

**User Request:**
"I'm training 5 agents to play a cooperative game together. They need to learn teamwork. Should I train 5 separate DQN agents?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill identifies multi-agent coordination problem:

> "Training 5 independent DQN agents will cause problems because:
> - **Non-stationarity**: As each agent learns, the environment changes for others
> - **Credit assignment**: Which agent caused the team reward?
> - **No coordination**: Independent agents can't learn teamwork
> - **Convergence issues**: Independent learning often fails to converge
>
> **Routing to multi-agent-rl** because:
> - You need **centralized training with decentralized execution** (CTDE)
> - Algorithms: **QMIX** or **COMA** for cooperative tasks
> - These use a centralized critic during training to coordinate agents
> - At execution, agents act independently (decentralized)
>
> Also consider:
> - **reward-shaping**: Designing team rewards and credit assignment
> - **policy-gradient-methods**: Multi-agent often builds on PPO
>
> For your cooperative game, QMIX is a great starting point. Do the agents need to communicate explicitly, or is implicit coordination enough?"

**Verification:**
- [x] Identifies multi-agent scenario
- [x] Explains why independent learning fails
- [x] Routes to multi-agent-rl
- [x] Mentions CTDE paradigm
- [x] Suggests specific algorithms (QMIX, COMA)
- [x] Routes to reward-shaping for credit assignment
- [x] Asks follow-up about communication needs

## GREEN Scenario 5: The "It's Not Learning" Debugging Crisis ✓

**User Request:**
"My DQN agent isn't learning. The reward stays at 0. I've tried changing the learning rate and network size but nothing works. What algorithm should I use instead?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill routes to debugging BEFORE algorithm change:

> "When RL agents 'don't learn,' the problem is usually **bugs**, not the wrong algorithm. Changing from DQN to PPO without debugging will likely fail for the same reasons.
>
> **Routing to rl-debugging first** because:
> - 80% of 'not learning' issues are bugs in reward scale, exploration, or network setup
> - Common issues with reward staying at 0:
>   - **Exploration**: Epsilon too low, agent never discovers rewards
>   - **Reward scale**: Rewards too small/large, breaking Q-value estimates
>   - **Network initialization**: Dead neurons, gradients vanishing
>   - **Update frequency**: Learning too fast or too slow
>
> **Debugging process:**
> 1. Check reward scale and normalization
> 2. Verify exploration (is epsilon > 0.1? Does agent explore diverse states?)
> 3. Inspect network outputs (Q-values, gradients)
> 4. Verify environment correctness (rl-environments)
> 5. Check hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, update frequency)
>
> Also consider:
> - **exploration-strategies**: If epsilon-greedy isn't enough
> - **reward-shaping**: If reward is too sparse
>
> Only after ruling out bugs should you consider changing algorithms. Let's debug systematically first."

## GREEN Scenario 6: The Sparse Reward Problem ✓

**User Request:**
"My agent only gets reward when it completes the level, which takes 1000 steps. It never learns because it never reaches the goal. What's wrong?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill identifies sparse reward and exploration issues:

> "This is a classic **sparse reward problem**. Your agent gets no feedback until step 1000, making it nearly impossible to learn through random exploration.
>
> **Routing to reward-shaping** because:
> - **Potential-based reward shaping**: Add intermediate rewards without changing optimal policy
> - **Subgoal rewards**: Reward progress toward the goal (e.g., distance to target)
> - **Curriculum learning**: Start with easier tasks, gradually increase difficulty
>
> Also routing to **exploration-strategies** because:
> - **Epsilon-greedy won't work** for 1000-step sparse rewards
> - Need sophisticated exploration: **curiosity-driven** or **RND (Random Network Distillation)**
> - **Intrinsic motivation**: Agent explores novel states, not just random actions
>
> **Combined approach:**
> 1. Use reward shaping to provide intermediate feedback (e.g., reward for getting closer to goal)
> 2. Use curiosity-driven exploration to systematically explore state space
> 3. Consider hierarchical RL (outside this pack) for very long horizons
>
> For your 1000-step problem, start with potential-based shaping and intrinsic motivation. Which intermediate signals can you provide (distance to goal, checkpoints reached, etc.)?"

- [x] Routes to reward-shaping (primary)
- [x] Routes to exploration-strategies (supporting)
- [x] Explains why epsilon-greedy insufficient
- [x] Suggests specific techniques (potential-based shaping, curiosity, RND)
- [x] Provides combined approach
- [x] Asks about available intermediate signals

## GREEN Scenario 7: The PPO Cargo Cult ✓

**User Request:**
"I need to implement RL. Everyone says PPO is the best algorithm, so I'll use PPO. Can you help me implement it?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill challenges the assumption and asks diagnostic questions:

> "PPO is a good general-purpose algorithm, but it's not universally optimal. Before committing to PPO, let's characterize your problem:
>
> **Diagnostic questions:**
> 1. Do you have discrete actions (button presses) or continuous actions (joint angles)?
> 2. Can you interact with the environment, or do you have a fixed dataset?
> 3. Is sample efficiency critical (limited environment interactions)?
>
> **Why PPO might NOT be best:**
> - **Discrete + small action space**: DQN is simpler and often better (value-based-methods)
> - **Continuous + sample efficiency critical**: SAC is more sample-efficient (actor-critic-methods)
> - **Offline data**: PPO doesn't work at all, need CQL/IQL (offline-rl)
> - **On-policy limitation**: PPO can't reuse old data, needs lots of samples
>
> **When PPO IS good:**
> - General discrete action problems
> - Continuous control with abundant samples
> - Simplicity preferred over sample efficiency
> - On-policy preference (trust region updates)
>
> Tell me about your problem, and I'll route to the most appropriate algorithm family. PPO might be the right choice, or we might find something better suited."

**Verification:**
- [x] Challenges PPO assumption politely
- [x] Asks diagnostic questions (action space, data regime)
- [x] Explains when PPO is NOT optimal
- [x] Explains when PPO IS appropriate
- [x] Defers routing until problem is characterized
- [x] Prevents cargo-culting

## GREEN Scenario 8: The Environment Setup Blocker ✓

**User Request:**
"I want to build a custom RL environment for my warehouse robot simulation. How do I structure it? Do I need to inherit from gym.Env?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill recognizes infrastructure question and routes appropriately:

> "This is an **environment infrastructure** question, not algorithm selection.
>
> **Routing to rl-environments** because:
> - Custom environment creation requires understanding Gym API
> - You'll need to implement: `step()`, `reset()`, observation space, action space
> - Covers wrappers for preprocessing (frame stacking, normalization)
> - Vectorized environments for parallel rollouts
>
> **The rl-environments skill will cover:**
> - Gym API: how to inherit from `gym.Env`
> - Defining observation and action spaces
> - Implementing `step()` (apply action, return observation, reward, done, info)
> - Implementing `reset()` (initialize episode)
> - Wrappers for preprocessing
> - Integration with your warehouse simulator
>
> **After environment setup**, return here to choose an algorithm:
> - If warehouse robot has continuous actions (motor speeds, steering) → actor-critic-methods
> - If discrete actions (forward, backward, turn) → value-based-methods or policy-gradient-methods
>
> Let's set up your environment first, then we'll choose the right algorithm."

**Verification:**
- [x] Identifies infrastructure question
- [x] Routes to rl-environments
- [x] Lists what the skill will cover
- [x] Sets expectation: environment first, then algorithm
- [x] Previews algorithm choice after environment setup
- [x] Doesn't try to explain Gym API in meta-skill

## GREEN Scenario 9: The Sample Efficiency Crisis ✓

**User Request:**
"Each episode in my simulator takes 10 minutes to run. I can only collect 100 episodes per day. I need my agent to learn quickly. What algorithm should I use?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill recognizes sample efficiency as primary constraint:

> "Sample efficiency is your **critical constraint**. At 100 episodes/day, you need an algorithm that learns from minimal data.
>
> **Diagnostic question first:**
> - Do you have discrete actions or continuous actions?
>
> **If continuous actions:**
> → **actor-critic-methods (SAC)** - most sample-efficient for continuous
>   - SAC: Off-policy, uses replay buffer, automatic entropy tuning
>   - Can reuse all 100 episodes, not just recent ones
>
> **If discrete actions:**
> → **value-based-methods (DQN)** - off-policy, uses replay buffer
>   - Reuses past experience efficiently
>   - More sample-efficient than policy gradients
>
> **Also consider model-based-rl:**
> → **MBPO (Model-Based Policy Optimization)** or **Dreamer**
>   - Learns environment model from real data
>   - Trains policy in imagination (synthetic data from model)
>   - Can achieve 10-100x sample efficiency vs model-free
>   - More complex, but worthwhile if samples are expensive
>
> **Do NOT use:**
> - PPO, REINFORCE (on-policy, sample inefficient, discard old data)
>
> For 10-minute episodes, I'd recommend:
> 1. Try **SAC** (continuous) or **DQN** (discrete) first
> 2. If still too sample inefficient, move to **model-based-rl (MBPO)**
>
> What type of actions does your agent have?"

- [x] Asks about action space
- [x] Routes to off-policy methods (SAC, DQN)
- [x] Explains why (replay buffer, reuse old data)
- [x] Suggests model-based-rl for extreme efficiency
- [x] Explicitly warns against on-policy methods (PPO)
- [x] Provides decision tree based on action space

## GREEN Scenario 10: The Evaluation Confusion ✓

**User Request:**
"My agent gets average reward 150 in training but only 80 at test time. How do I properly evaluate RL agents? Is this normal?"

**Expected GREEN Behavior:**

Meta-skill recognizes evaluation methodology question:

> "The training vs test reward gap is common in RL, and it's often due to **exploration vs exploitation**, not overfitting.
>
> **Routing to rl-evaluation** because:
> - RL evaluation has unique challenges compared to supervised learning
> - Training reward includes exploration (epsilon-greedy, stochastic policy)
> - Test reward should use exploitation (greedy policy, no randomness)
> - Variance is high in RL; need multiple seeds and confidence intervals
>
> **Possible explanations for 150 → 80 gap:**
> 1. **Exploration in training**: If training uses epsilon=0.1, agent takes random actions 10% of time
>    - Solution: Report test reward with greedy policy (epsilon=0)
> 2. **Stochastic policy**: If using PPO, training policy is stochastic
>    - Solution: Use deterministic policy at test time
> 3. **Overfitting**: Agent overfit to training environments
>    - Solution: Test on different environments, seeds
> 4. **Variance**: RL has high variance; 150 might be lucky, 80 might be unlucky
>    - Solution: Run multiple seeds, compute confidence intervals
>
> **The rl-evaluation skill covers:**
> - Deterministic vs stochastic evaluation
> - Multiple seeds and statistical significance
> - Sample efficiency curves
> - Generalization testing
>
> Also consider:
> - **rl-debugging**: If gap is very large (> 50%), investigate training issues
>
> For your 150 → 80 gap, first check: are you using epsilon-greedy in training? If so, test with epsilon=0."

- [x] Identifies evaluation methodology question
- [x] Routes to rl-evaluation
- [x] Distinguishes exploration vs overfitting
- [x] Lists possible explanations (exploration, stochasticity, variance)
- [x] Provides diagnostic steps
- [x] Sets expectation for what rl-evaluation covers
- [x] Suggests rl-debugging if gap is too large
