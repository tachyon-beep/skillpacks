# GREEN Phase: using-training-optimization Skill Verification

## Purpose

Test the using-training-optimization meta-skill against RED phase scenarios to verify it provides correct routing, diagnostic protocols, and eliminates baseline failures.

## Test Methodology

Apply the skill to each RED phase scenario and document:
1. Does skill provide correct diagnostic questions?
2. Does skill route to correct specialist skill(s)?
3. Does skill resist rationalizations and pressure?
4. Does behavioral transformation address baseline failures?

## Scenario 1: Ambiguous Training Issue - "Model Not Learning"

### User Query
```
"My model isn't learning. The loss is stuck at 0.85 and not going down. I've tried training for 50 epochs but no improvement. What should I do?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes "model not learning" symptom (in routing table)
- Provides diagnostic questions BEFORE routing:
  - "Is loss completely flat from the start, decreasing very slowly, or was it learning then stopped?"
  - "Any NaN or Inf values in your loss?"
  - "What optimizer and learning rate are you using?"

**After clarification, skill routes based on symptoms:**
- If "flat from start" → **learning-rate-scheduling** + **optimization-algorithms**
- If "was learning, then plateaued" → **learning-rate-scheduling** (need schedule/adaptation)
- If "oscillating" → **learning-rate-scheduling** + **gradient-management**
- If contains NaN → **gradient-management** (PRIMARY)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Asks diagnostic questions before routing (not jumping to solutions)
- ✅ Multiple possible skills identified based on symptom details
- ✅ Clear routing logic based on loss behavior pattern
- ✅ Eliminates single-cause assumption from RED phase

---

## Scenario 2: Loss Goes to NaN

### User Query
```
"Help! My training was going fine for 5 epochs, then suddenly the loss became NaN. This is urgent - I need to fix this for a demo tomorrow!"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes time pressure but RESISTS skipping diagnosis
- Pressure resistance section: "Emergency protocol: Fast clarification (30 sec) → Correct routing"
- Provides quick diagnostic questions:
  - "Is this with mixed precision?"
  - "What's your LR and schedule?"
  - "What loss function are you using?"

**Routing:**
- Primary: **gradient-management** (gradient explosion most common for sudden NaN)
- Secondary: **learning-rate-scheduling** (if LR schedule increases too much)
- Tertiary: **loss-functions-and-objectives** (numerical instability)
- Cross-pack: If mixed precision mentioned → pytorch-engineering

**Verification:**
- ✅ Resists time pressure rationalization
- ✅ Still asks diagnostic questions (fast, focused)
- ✅ Routes to gradient-management first (correct priority)
- ✅ Acknowledges urgency but maintains systematic approach
- ✅ Eliminates trial-and-error from RED phase

---

## Scenario 3: Overfitting on Small Dataset

### User Query
```
"My model gets 95% accuracy on training set but only 60% on validation set. I have about 1000 training examples. How do I fix this overfitting?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes "overfitting" symptom (clear in routing table)
- Dataset size (1000 examples) is provided, so skill notes this is SMALL dataset
- Multi-skill routing scenario identified

**Routing (multi-pronged approach):**
1. **overfitting-prevention** (PRIMARY) - regularization, dropout, early stopping
2. **data-augmentation-strategies** (CRITICAL for small dataset) - increase effective size
3. **hyperparameter-tuning** - find optimal regularization strength

**Priority guidance:**
- Skill explicitly notes: "Small dataset (< 1K): data-augmentation is CRITICAL"
- Both skills needed together, not just one

**Verification:**
- ✅ Multi-skill routing (not single technique)
- ✅ Dataset size influences priority (augmentation critical for small data)
- ✅ Comprehensive strategy vs single solution
- ✅ Eliminates single-technique approach from RED phase

---

## Scenario 4: Training Too Slow

### User Query
```
"My training is really slow - it takes 10 minutes per epoch and I need to run 100 epochs. My GPU utilization is only 30%. How can I speed this up?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes "training slow" symptom
- CRITICAL: Diagnostic protocol for bottleneck identification
- GPU utilization 30% = NOT compute-bound (key diagnostic info provided)

**Diagnostic logic:**
- Skill references routing table by GPU utilization
- 30% GPU util → data loading bottleneck OR CPU preprocessing
- Routes to **pytorch-engineering** (data loading, profiling), NOT training-optimization

**Boundary clarification:**
- Cross-pack routing: This is infrastructure issue, not training algorithm
- Skill explicitly states: "Low GPU utilization suggests data loading or CPU bottleneck"
- "Route to pytorch-engineering (data loading, profiling) for diagnosis"

**Verification:**
- ✅ Diagnoses bottleneck BEFORE routing
- ✅ Correctly identifies cross-pack issue
- ✅ Routes to pytorch-engineering, not training-optimization
- ✅ Doesn't suggest batch size changes (wrong solution for data loading issue)
- ✅ Eliminates incorrect routing from RED phase

---

## Scenario 5: Which Optimizer Question

### User Query
```
"I'm starting a new project training a CNN for image classification. Which optimizer should I use - SGD, Adam, or AdamW? And what learning rate?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes direct question: "which optimizer"
- Routing table has explicit entry for this
- Identifies this as "new project setup" multi-skill scenario

**Routing:**
1. **optimization-algorithms** - choose optimizer for CNN image classification
2. **learning-rate-scheduling** - choose initial LR and schedule
3. **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** - determine batch size
4. **experiment-tracking** - set up tracking
5. **training-loop-architecture** - design training loop

**Sequential routing:**
- Skill provides "new training setup" workflow
- Routes to multiple skills in dependency order
- Optimizer + LR are interdependent, both needed

**Verification:**
- ✅ Routes to specialist skills instead of giving direct answer
- ✅ Multi-skill workflow for new project
- ✅ Correct order (foundation → infrastructure)
- ✅ Eliminates direct generic advice from RED phase

---

## Scenario 6: Multiple Concurrent Issues

### User Query
```
"My model is overfitting (train acc 90%, val acc 65%), training is slow (5 min/epoch), and sometimes I see loss spikes during training. I'm using SGD with LR 0.1, batch size 32 on a ResNet50 with 2000 training images."
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes MULTIPLE issues (overfitting + slow + unstable)
- Multi-issue scenario protocol
- Prioritization framework: "Stability → Convergence → Overfitting → Speed"

**Issue analysis:**
1. Loss spikes + LR 0.1 → **learning-rate-scheduling** (LR too high) + **gradient-management**
2. Overfitting (90% → 65%) on 2000 images → **overfitting-prevention** + **data-augmentation**
3. Slow training → Need to profile first

**Routing order:**
1. **gradient-management** + **learning-rate-scheduling** (stability FIRST)
2. **overfitting-prevention** + **data-augmentation-strategies** (after stability)
3. Check GPU utilization for speed issue (might be consequence of small batch size)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Identifies all three issues
- ✅ Provides prioritization (stability first)
- ✅ Multi-skill routing with rationale
- ✅ Recognizes interdependencies (LR too high causes instability)
- ✅ Eliminates scattered advice from RED phase

---

## Scenario 7: Vague Symptom - "Training Not Working Well"

### User Query
```
"My training isn't working well. Can you help me improve it?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes vague/ambiguous query
- Clarification protocol section applies
- "When symptom unclear, ASK ONE diagnostic question"

**Clarifying question:**
- "What specifically isn't working? Not learning? Unstable? Overfitting? Too slow?"
- OR: "What's 'not working'? Loss behavior? Accuracy? Convergence speed?"

**After clarification:**
- Routes based on specific symptom provided
- Does NOT give generic advice without clarification

**Verification:**
- ✅ Identifies vague query
- ✅ Asks structured clarifying question
- ✅ Refuses to route without specific symptoms
- ✅ Eliminates generic advice from RED phase

---

## Scenario 8: Cross-Pack Confusion - Distributed Training Memory Issues

### User Query
```
"I'm trying to train a large model with DDP on 4 GPUs but getting CUDA OOM errors. Should I adjust my batch size or training parameters?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes keywords: "DDP", "CUDA OOM"
- "When NOT to Use Training-Optimization" section applies
- Cross-pack boundary clearly defined

**Boundary identification:**
- "DDP not working" → pytorch-engineering (in routing mistakes table)
- "CUDA out of memory" → pytorch-engineering (in cross-pack boundaries)
- Distributed setup issue, not training hyperparameter issue

**Routing:**
- Primary: **pytorch-engineering** (distributed-training-strategies + tensor-operations-and-memory)
- Secondary: After distributed setup fixed, THEN consider batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs

**Verification:**
- ✅ Correctly identifies cross-pack issue
- ✅ Routes to pytorch-engineering FIRST
- ✅ Explains batch size is secondary to fixing DDP setup
- ✅ Clear boundary between infrastructure and hyperparameters
- ✅ Eliminates cross-pack confusion from RED phase

---

## Scenario 9: User Self-Diagnosis - Wrong Attribution

### User Query
```
"I think my optimizer is wrong. I'm using SGD but my model isn't converging. Should I switch to Adam?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes user self-diagnosis
- "User Self-Diagnosis Pressure" section applies
- Verification protocol: "User attribution is hypothesis, not diagnosis"

**Response:**
- Does NOT accept user diagnosis without verification
- Asks diagnostic questions:
  - "What do you mean by 'not converging'? Loss flat? Decreasing slowly? Oscillating?"
  - "What's your learning rate and schedule?"

**After diagnosis:**
- If loss flat from start → Could be LR too low, not optimizer
- If oscillating → Could be LR too high
- Routes based on actual symptoms, not user's guess

**Verification:**
- ✅ Verifies user diagnosis with questions
- ✅ Routes based on symptoms, not user attribution
- ✅ Could reveal issue is LR, not optimizer
- ✅ Eliminates accepting user self-diagnosis from RED phase

---

## Scenario 10: Expert User with Technical Question

### User Query
```
"I'm implementing a custom multi-task loss with uncertainty weighting and I'm seeing numerical instability. Should I approach this as a gradient management issue or loss function design issue?"
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes expert-level technical question
- Skill does NOT skip routing for expert users
- "Expert user doesn't need routing" is in rationalization table as FALSE

**Routing:**
- Primary: **loss-functions-and-objectives** (multi-task loss design, uncertainty weighting)
- Secondary: **gradient-management** (numerical instability, gradient balancing per task)
- Tertiary: **hyperparameter-tuning** (tune task weights)

**Multi-skill approach:**
- Both skills relevant (loss design + gradient analysis)
- Skill explicitly has this scenario: "Multi-Task Learning or Custom Loss"
- Expert benefits from both specialists

**Verification:**
- ✅ Routes expert users to specialist skills
- ✅ Multi-skill routing for complex scenario
- ✅ Doesn't bypass routing based on user sophistication
- ✅ Eliminates "expert doesn't need routing" from RED phase

---

## Scenario 11: Time Pressure - Quick Answer Request

### User Query
```
"Quick question - what learning rate scheduler should I use? Need a fast answer, I'm in the middle of a run."
```

### Expected Behavior WITH Skill

**Skill guidance:**
- Recognizes time pressure
- "Time/Emergency Pressure" section explicitly addresses this
- Rationalization table: "User is rushed, skip diagnostic questions" → FALSE

**Response:**
- Resists time pressure
- Quick clarification protocol: "30-second clarification ensures right answer"
- "What optimizer? Task type? Current symptoms?"
- Routes to **learning-rate-scheduling**

**Rationale:**
- "Diagnosis takes 30 seconds, wrong route wastes 10+ minutes"
- "Quick questions deserve correct answers from specialists"

**Verification:**
- ✅ Asks clarifying questions despite time pressure
- ✅ Routes to specialist (learning-rate-scheduling)
- ✅ Explains why clarification saves time overall
- ✅ Eliminates quick generic answers from RED phase
