# REFACTOR Phase: using-training-optimization Pressure Testing

## Purpose

Pressure test the using-training-optimization meta-skill with edge cases, complex scenarios, and rationalization temptations to identify gaps and bulletproof the skill.

## Test Methodology

Design adversarial scenarios that attempt to break the skill's routing logic, bypass diagnostic protocols, or trigger rationalization. Document any gaps found and verify skill handles them correctly.

---

## Edge Case 1: Misleading Keyword Avalanche

### User Query
```
"I'm using Adam optimizer with cosine annealing LR schedule and dropout regularization but my transformer model for NLP classification is showing unstable training with loss spikes. Should I try SGD instead?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Keyword overload:**
- "Adam", "SGD" → suggests optimization-algorithms
- "cosine annealing" → suggests learning-rate-scheduling
- "dropout" → suggests overfitting-prevention
- "transformer", "NLP" → could mislead to neural-architectures
- User suggests "try SGD" → self-diagnosis pressure

**Actual core issue:**
- "unstable training with loss spikes" → gradient-management or learning-rate-scheduling

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Skill recognizes "loss spikes" as primary symptom (in routing table)
- Ignores keyword avalanche, focuses on symptom
- Resists user self-diagnosis ("try SGD")
- Asks diagnostic questions:
  - "When do loss spikes occur? Early or late in training?"
  - "What's your current learning rate value?"
  - "Using mixed precision?"

**Routing:**
- Primary: **gradient-management** (loss spikes = instability)
- Secondary: **learning-rate-scheduling** (cosine annealing might not have proper warmup)
- NOT optimization-algorithms (switching optimizer won't fix instability)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Not hijacked by keywords
- ✅ Focuses on symptom, not configuration details
- ✅ Verifies user diagnosis before accepting
- ✅ Correct routing despite complexity

---

## Edge Case 2: Authority + Sunk Cost + Time Pressure Triple Threat

### User Query
```
"My team lead (PhD in ML, 10 years experience) insisted we use learning rate 0.001 with no scheduling. We've spent 3 weeks training experiments this way and now stakeholders are asking why results are poor. The team lead says 'just tune the batch size' but I'm worried that's not the issue. We have a review meeting in 2 hours. What do I do?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Multiple pressures:**
1. **Authority**: PhD, 10 years experience, team lead
2. **Sunk cost**: 3 weeks of experiments
3. **Time pressure**: 2 hours until meeting
4. **Hierarchical risk**: Questioning team lead might have social consequences
5. **Anchoring**: Team lead says "batch size", pulls away from LR issue

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes multiple pressure types
- "Authority/Hierarchy Pressure" section applies
- "Sunk Cost Pressure" section applies
- "Time/Emergency Pressure" section applies

**Protocol:**
1. Acknowledge pressures: "I understand: team lead suggested batch size, 3 weeks invested, meeting in 2 hours"
2. Professional framing: "To ensure productive meeting, let me verify symptoms"
3. Diagnostic questions: "What are the specific poor results? Loss behavior? Accuracy?"
4. Neutral verification: "This isn't questioning experience—confirming problem type ensures right solution"

**After symptoms verified:**
- If symptoms suggest LR scheduling needed:
  - "Based on symptoms [X, Y], this appears to be LR scheduling issue"
  - "Batch size affects training dynamics, but won't solve [specific symptom]"
  - Route to **learning-rate-scheduling**
- Frame as: "Let's verify the approach before meeting"

**Verification:**
- ✅ Doesn't defer to authority without symptom verification
- ✅ Doesn't accept sunk cost rationalization
- ✅ Maintains systematic diagnosis under time pressure
- ✅ Professional framing prevents confrontation
- ✅ Routes based on evidence, not hierarchy

---

## Edge Case 3: Cascading Multi-Issue Nightmare

### User Query
```
"Everything is broken. My model was training fine, then I added data augmentation to fix overfitting, but now training takes 3x longer, GPU utilization dropped to 20%, and I started seeing NaN losses occasionally. I also switched from Adam to SGD because someone said it generalizes better, and now I'm not sure what's causing what. I have a paper deadline in a week and I'm panicking."
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Complexity overload:**
- Multiple changes made simultaneously (augmentation, optimizer switch)
- Cascading issues (speed, GPU util, NaN)
- Unclear causal relationships
- Emotional state (panicking)
- Time pressure (paper deadline)

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes extreme complexity
- Doesn't oversimplify or give quick fixes
- Systematic untangling required

**Triage protocol:**
1. Acknowledge: "Multiple issues and deadline pressure—let's systematically untangle"
2. Prioritize by severity:
   - **CRITICAL**: NaN losses (training can't continue) → **gradient-management** FIRST
   - **HIGH**: 3x slower + 20% GPU (productivity blocker) → pytorch-engineering (profiling) AFTER stability
   - **MEDIUM**: Overfitting (original issue) → return to this after stability/speed fixed

3. Isolate changes:
   - "Let's identify which change caused which issue"
   - "NaN after switching to SGD suggests learning rate too high for SGD"
   - "20% GPU + 3x slower after augmentation suggests CPU-bound augmentation"

**Multi-skill routing (sequential, not parallel):**
1. **gradient-management** + **learning-rate-scheduling** - Fix NaN first (SGD needs different LR than Adam)
2. **pytorch-engineering** (data loading, profiling) - Profile augmentation overhead
3. **data-augmentation-strategies** - Optimize augmentation after profiling
4. **overfitting-prevention** - Return to original overfitting issue

**Verification:**
- ✅ Doesn't panic-route or oversimplify
- ✅ Prioritizes by severity (stability → speed → original issue)
- ✅ Untangles causal relationships
- ✅ Sequential routing with clear rationale
- ✅ Addresses emotional state with systematic plan

---

## Edge Case 4: Cross-Pack Gray Zone - Gradient Checkpointing

### User Query
```
"I need to reduce memory usage during training. Should I use gradient checkpointing or adjust my batch size? Or is this a training-optimization issue or pytorch-engineering?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Boundary ambiguity:**
- Gradient checkpointing = PyTorch implementation technique
- Batch size = training optimization hyperparameter
- Memory = could be either pack
- User explicitly uncertain about boundary

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes boundary question
- "When NOT to Use Training-Optimization" section applies

**Clarification:**
- "Memory reduction has two approaches:"
  1. **Gradient checkpointing** → pytorch-engineering (implementation technique, torch.utils.checkpoint)
  2. **Batch size + gradient accumulation** → training-optimization (batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs)

**Routing decision:**
- Ask: "Are you getting OOM errors, or just want to use memory more efficiently?"
- If OOM errors: **pytorch-engineering** FIRST (memory profiling, gradient checkpointing, mixed precision)
- Then: **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** (adjust batch size, gradient accumulation)

**Cross-pack workflow:**
1. **pytorch-engineering** (tensor-operations-and-memory) - Memory profiling and checkpointing
2. **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** - Optimize batch size given memory constraints

**Verification:**
- ✅ Clarifies boundary explicitly
- ✅ Both packs may be needed (sequential)
- ✅ Explains which pack handles which aspect
- ✅ User confusion addressed directly

---

## Edge Case 5: False Confidence - "I Know What's Wrong"

### User Query
```
"I've done extensive analysis and I'm 100% certain my problem is the optimizer. I've tried Adam, AdamW, and SGD with momentum. None work. I need you to tell me which exotic optimizer to try next—maybe AdaBound, RAdam, or Lookahead. Don't waste time with diagnostics, I've already eliminated everything else."
```

### Pressure Analysis

**False confidence signals:**
- "100% certain"
- "extensive analysis"
- "I've already eliminated everything else"
- Demands specific action, rejects diagnostics
- Sophisticated optimizer vocabulary
- Pressure to skip verification

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes false confidence pattern
- "User Self-Diagnosis Pressure" section applies
- Red flag: "User suggested X" rationalization

**Professional pushback:**
```
"I hear you've tried multiple optimizers systematically. That's valuable data.

However, before suggesting more optimizers, let's verify the root cause. If 3+ different
optimizers all fail, the issue is likely NOT the optimizer—it's usually learning rate,
gradients, or loss function.

Quick diagnostic (2 minutes) to confirm optimizer is the actual bottleneck:
1. What's your loss behavior with each optimizer? (flat, oscillating, NaN?)
2. What learning rates did you use with each?
3. Have you checked gradient norms?

This verification prevents trying 10 more optimizers with the same underlying issue."
```

**After diagnostics:**
- If LR was same for all optimizers → **learning-rate-scheduling** (each optimizer needs different LR)
- If gradients vanishing/exploding → **gradient-management**
- If symptoms genuinely optimizer-specific → **optimization-algorithms**

**Verification:**
- ✅ Respectfully challenges user certainty
- ✅ Validates user effort while questioning conclusion
- ✅ Provides rationale for diagnostics
- ✅ Routes based on symptoms, not user confidence

---

## Edge Case 6: The "Just Tell Me" Demanding Tone

### User Query
```
"Look, I don't have time for questions. Just tell me: for a ResNet50 on ImageNet, what optimizer and learning rate should I use? That's all I need. Quick answer, no explanations."
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Demanding tone pressure:**
- "I don't have time for questions"
- "Just tell me"
- "Quick answer, no explanations"
- Rejecting diagnostic protocol
- Commanding communication style

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- "Demanding Tone" pressure section applies
- Maintains professional boundaries
- Red flags: "They said 'just tell me', skip questions"

**Response:**
```
"To give you the RIGHT answer efficiently (saves time overall), I need one clarification:

Are you:
A) Starting from scratch (need standard baseline)
B) Having specific issues (not learning, overfitting, etc.)

This determines completely different recommendations. Answer A or B takes 2 seconds,
ensures you don't waste hours on wrong configuration."
```

**After clarification:**
- If A (starting from scratch): Route to **optimization-algorithms** + **learning-rate-scheduling** for baseline
- If B (having issues): Diagnostic questions for symptom-based routing

**Verification:**
- ✅ Maintains boundaries despite demanding tone
- ✅ Explains time-saving rationale
- ✅ Minimal but essential clarification
- ✅ Doesn't give generic answer without context

---

## Edge Case 7: Vague Everything - Maximum Ambiguity

### User Query
```
"Training isn't working right. Can you help?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Maximum ambiguity:**
- "isn't working right" (no specific symptom)
- No details whatsoever
- No context
- Could be ANY training issue

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- "Ambiguous Queries - Clarification Protocol" section applies
- Structured clarification required

**Response:**
```
"To route you to the right specialist, I need to understand the specific issue.

What specifically 'isn't working right'?
A) Model not learning (loss stuck, accuracy not improving)
B) Training unstable (loss spikes, NaN values)
C) Model overfits (good training, poor validation)
D) Training too slow
E) Something else

Please specify the main symptom—this determines which specialist skill to use."
```

**After clarification:**
- Routes based on symptom chosen
- If still vague, ask follow-up diagnostic question

**Verification:**
- ✅ Refuses to route without specifics
- ✅ Structured clarification options
- ✅ Explains why clarification needed
- ✅ No generic advice given

---

## Edge Case 8: Expert-Level Nuance - Subtle Diagnostic Challenge

### User Query
```
"I'm seeing loss oscillations with period matching my LR schedule cosine cycle. Could this be optimizer momentum interacting with LR changes, or is my LR schedule too aggressive? The oscillations don't hurt final performance but make monitoring harder."
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Expert-level complexity:**
- Sophisticated technical understanding
- Multiple valid hypotheses
- Subtle interactions (momentum × LR schedule)
- Not a critical problem (monitoring difficulty)
- Tempting to engage in technical discussion

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes expert user
- Doesn't bypass routing despite sophistication
- Multiple skills potentially relevant

**Response:**
```
"Excellent observation about the interaction. This involves:

1. **learning-rate-scheduling** (PRIMARY) - Cosine schedule tuning, cycle period
2. **optimization-algorithms** (SECONDARY) - Momentum interactions with LR changes

Let me route you to learning-rate-scheduling first for cycle parameter tuning,
then optimization-algorithms if we need to adjust momentum coefficient to dampen oscillations."
```

**Routing:**
- Respects expert level while still routing
- Multi-skill scenario identified
- Sophisticated diagnosis still benefits from specialist skills

**Verification:**
- ✅ Routes expert users appropriately
- ✅ Acknowledges sophisticated understanding
- ✅ Multi-skill routing for complex interaction
- ✅ Doesn't engage in direct technical solution

---

## Edge Case 9: Overloaded Context - Training War Stories

### User Query
```
"Let me give you the full context. Three months ago we started this project with VGG but switched to ResNet, then tried EfficientNet. We had memory issues so we changed batch size from 128 to 64 to 32. Initially we used SGD but papers said Adam is better so we switched. Then we added augmentation. Then we tried learning rate 0.1, 0.01, 0.001. We tried dropout 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. Some configurations showed NaN, some overfit, some were just slow. Now we're confused what the actual problem is. The current issue is the model gets 80% training accuracy but only 60% validation accuracy. What should we do?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Information overload:**
- Extensive history (3 months, many changes)
- Multiple architectures tried
- Many hyperparameter trials
- Mix of symptoms (NaN, overfitting, slow)
- **Current issue**: 80% train, 60% val (20% gap = overfitting)

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes information overload
- Focuses on CURRENT symptom, not history
- History provides context but doesn't change routing

**Response:**
```
"I understand you've tried many approaches over 3 months. Let's focus on your
current issue: 80% train / 60% val accuracy = 20-point overfitting gap.

Setting aside the history, current symptom suggests:
1. **overfitting-prevention** (PRIMARY) - Regularization strategy
2. **data-augmentation-strategies** - Increase effective data diversity
3. **hyperparameter-tuning** - Systematically find optimal regularization

Your history shows you've tried individual techniques (dropout, augmentation separately).
These skills will help you combine them systematically and tune the right strengths."
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Not overwhelmed by context
- ✅ Extracts current symptom
- ✅ Routes based on current issue
- ✅ Acknowledges history but doesn't get lost in it
- ✅ Identifies gap in past approach (unsystematic trials)

## Edge Case 10: Implicit Multi-Pack - Deployment Disguised as Training

### User Query
```
"My model needs to run on mobile devices with limited memory. Should I use a smaller batch size during training, or train with higher dropout to compress the model? I need the trained model to be smaller and faster."
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Hidden cross-pack issue:**
- Appears to be training question (batch size, dropout)
- Actually deployment constraint (mobile, memory, smaller/faster)
- Conflating training techniques with deployment optimization
- Wrong pack entirely

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes deployment concern disguised as training question
- "When NOT to Use Training-Optimization" section applies

**Response:**
```
"I notice the core requirement is deployment to mobile (smaller, faster model for constrained devices).

This is a **ml-production** concern (model compression, quantization, mobile optimization), NOT training-optimization.

Training techniques (batch size, dropout) won't achieve your goal:
- Batch size doesn't affect final model size
- Dropout helps generalization, not model compression

Route to **ml-production** for:
- Quantization (INT8, pruning)
- Mobile-specific optimization
- Knowledge distillation (if you need smaller architecture)

Then train that compressed/smaller model with training-optimization techniques."
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Identifies hidden cross-pack issue
- ✅ Corrects misunderstanding about training techniques
- ✅ Routes to correct pack (ml-production)
- ✅ Explains why training-optimization won't solve it
- ✅ Prevents wasted effort in wrong domain

---

## Edge Case 11: Premature Optimization - "Best Practices"

### User Query
```
"I'm starting a new image classification project. I want to use best practices from the start. Should I set up hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, use mixed precision training, gradient accumulation, learning rate warmup, cosine annealing, weight decay, dropout, label smoothing, and mixup augmentation? What's the optimal configuration?"
```

### Pressure Analysis

**Premature optimization:**
- Wants everything at once
- No training done yet
- No symptoms to diagnose
- "Best practices" thinking
- Complex setup before baseline

**Skill Response:**

✅ **Correct behavior:**
- Recognizes premature optimization
- New project setup protocol applies

**Response:**
```
"Start with a working baseline BEFORE optimizing everything.

For new project, sequential setup:

1. **Phase 1 - Baseline (Days 1-2)**:
   - Route to **optimization-algorithms** - Choose standard optimizer
   - Route to **learning-rate-scheduling** - Set reasonable initial LR
   - Train baseline with minimal complexity

2. **Phase 2 - Stabilize (Days 3-4)**:
   - Diagnose any issues (NaN, not learning, etc.)
   - Route based on symptoms

3. **Phase 3 - Optimize (Week 2+)**:
   - **overfitting-prevention** if overfitting
   - **data-augmentation** for better generalization
   - **hyperparameter-tuning** for systematic search

Don't implement everything at once—you won't know what helps or hurts. Start simple, add complexity based on observed needs."
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Prevents premature complexity
- ✅ Phased approach (baseline → diagnose → optimize)
- ✅ Routes to appropriate skills at each phase
- ✅ Explains rationale against "everything at once"

---

## Rationalization Gaps Identified

### Additional Rationalizations to Add

Based on pressure testing, these rationalizations should be explicitly countered:

| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "User is 100% certain, trust their diagnosis" | Certainty ≠ correctness, multiple optimizer failures suggest non-optimizer issue | "If 3+ optimizers all fail, likely NOT optimizer—verify with diagnostics" |
| "Too much context to parse, give generic advice" | Extract current symptom from noise | "Focus on current symptom regardless of history" |
| "Deployment disguised as training, answer training question" | Wrong pack entirely | "This is deployment concern, not training—route to ml-production" |
| "Expert user asking subtle question, engage directly" | Expert still benefits from specialist routing | "Route to specialists—they handle expert-level nuance" |
| "User wants everything, list all techniques" | Premature optimization, start simple | "Baseline first, complexity based on symptoms" |

### Additional Red Flags

| Red Flag | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| User lists many failed attempts | Likely wrong diagnosis, not exhausting possibilities | Verify root cause, don't suggest more of same |
| Deployment keywords (mobile, edge, latency) with training question | Cross-pack confusion | Route to ml-production, not training-optimization |
| "Best practices" request without symptoms | Premature optimization | Phased approach: baseline → diagnose → optimize |
| Extensive history but unclear current state | Information overload | Extract current symptom, ignore history noise |

---

## Skill Updates Required

### 1. Enhanced Rationalization Table

Add to existing table:

```markdown
| "User is 100% certain of diagnosis" | Certainty doesn't mean correct, especially if multiple solutions failed | "Let's verify—if 3+ approaches failed, likely wrong diagnosis" |
| "Too much context/history to process" | Current symptom matters, not history | "Focus on current issue, history provides context only" |
| "User wants all best practices upfront" | Premature optimization before symptoms observed | "Start simple baseline, optimize based on observed needs" |
| "Expert user with nuanced question" | Experts benefit from specialists too | "Route to specialists—they handle nuanced interactions" |
| "Deployment constraint phrased as training question" | Different pack entirely | "This is ml-production concern, not training-optimization" |
```

### 2. Additional Red Flag

Add to checklist:

```markdown
7. ❓ **Is user describing deployment constraints?**
   - Keywords: mobile, edge, latency, model size, inference speed
   - If yes → Route to ml-production, NOT training-optimization
   - Training techniques don't achieve deployment optimization
```

### 3. False Confidence Pattern

Add subsection to "Pressure Resistance":

```markdown
### False Confidence / Exhausted Options

| Pressure | Wrong Response | Correct Response |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "I've tried 5 optimizers, none work" | Suggest 6th optimizer | "If 5 optimizers fail, likely not optimizer—let's verify: [diagnostics]" |
| "I'm 100% certain it's X" | Accept certainty as truth | "Certainty is valuable, let's verify with quick diagnostic: [question]" |
| "I've tried everything in X skill" | Give up or suggest other skill | "Let's verify you were in right skill—symptom diagnosis: [question]" |
```
