# actor-critic-methods - REFACTOR Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-30
Status: Advanced pressure scenarios and robustness validation complete

## Pressure Scenario 1: Complex Continuous Control Problem

**Scenario**: User has high-dimensional continuous control problem (16-dimensional robot action space). Previous attempts with PPO diverged. Needs guidance on actor-critic approach.

**Pressure**:
- Complex state/action spaces require careful architecture
- Sample efficiency critical (robot experiments expensive)
- Training instability common in high dimensions
- User frustrated with PPO results

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Problem Recognition**: Identifies that high-dimensional continuous control is actor-critic sweet spot
2. **Algorithm Choice**: SAC recommended (off-policy, auto-tuned entropy handles exploration in high dimensions)
3. **Architecture Guidance**:
   - Separate networks for actor and critics (required)
   - Two Q-networks mandatory (stability in high dimensions)
   - Layer sizes: 256-512 per layer typical for 16D
4. **Sample Efficiency Strategy**:
   - Replay buffer makes data expensive (robotics)
   - Off-policy learning → 4x data reuse
   - GAE advantage estimation (low variance)
5. **Stability Engineering**:
   - Soft target updates (τ = 0.005)
   - Reward normalization (scale-invariant learning)
   - Gradient clipping (prevents explosion in high-dimensional space)
   - Entropy auto-tuning (handles exploration automatically)
6. **Debugging Roadmap**:
   - If critic diverges: Check Bellman target, gradient clipping
   - If actor doesn't improve: Debug critic Q-values
   - If policy random: Check entropy auto-tuning (α being optimized?)
   - If training slow: Increase replay buffer reuse, check learning rates

**Result**: User understands actor-critic is right choice, gets systematic approach to high-dimensional problem, knows what to monitor.

## Pressure Scenario 2: SAC Entropy Coefficient Confusion

**Scenario**: User implements SAC, but can't decide between manual and auto-tuned entropy. Reads papers with both approaches. Confused about what "correct" SAC is.

**Pressure**:
- Literature has both manual α and auto-tuned α versions
- User doesn't understand the fundamental difference
- Manual tuning "worked" in some experiments
- Auto-tuning seems complex (why add optimization?)
- SAC original paper used manual, later work uses auto-tuned

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Original SAC (Haarnoja et al. 2018): Manual α
   - SAC with automatic entropy tuning (Haarnoja et al. 2019): Auto-tuned α
   - Modern practice: Auto-tuned α is standard

2. **Fundamental Difference**:
   - Manual α: Fixed exploration level across training
     - Requires manual tuning (0.2? 0.5? 1.0?)
     - Suboptimal: same α for early (needs exploration) and late (exploitation) training
     - Simple to implement
   - Auto-tuned α: Learns entropy coefficient
     - Minimizes α while maintaining target entropy
     - Exploration naturally decreases as policy improves
     - Requires entropy optimization (one extra loss)

3. **Why Auto-Tuning Better**:
   ```
   Early training: High entropy needed → α small initially → large entropy penalty
   Late training: Low entropy enough → α increases → smaller entropy penalty

   Manual α = constant throughout → suboptimal at both stages
   ```

4. **Implementation Guidance**:
   - Auto-tuned: Use log(α) parameterization to prevent explosion
   - Manual: Just set α = value, don't optimize
   - Clarifies: These are different algorithms, auto-tuned is SOTA

5. **When to Use Which**:
   - Auto-tuned (recommended): Standard SAC, continuous control, general purpose
   - Manual (legacy): Specific problems where exploration constant, or simplicity preferred

6. **Common Mistakes with Auto-Tuned**:
   - Using α directly instead of log(α) → explosion
   - Not setting target_entropy (-action_dim)
   - Not optimizing entropy loss properly

**Result**: User understands SAC evolution, knows auto-tuned is modern standard, can implement correctly.

## Pressure Scenario 3: Training Instability Systematic Diagnosis

**Scenario**: User has actor-critic training that's "sometimes stable, sometimes diverges". Returns noisy (high variance between runs). Debugging is frustrating because issue isn't consistent.

**Pressure**:
- Non-deterministic failures are hard to debug
- User tried many random fixes without understanding cause
- Performance variance makes tuning impossible
- Multiple interacting issues possible

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Systematic Debugging Framework**:
   Step 1: Check determinism
   ```python
   # Set all seeds for reproducibility
   torch.manual_seed(0)
   np.random.seed(0)
   env.seed(0)
   ```

   Step 2: Check critic convergence (most common cause of instability)
   ```python
   # Plot critic loss over time - should monotonically decrease
   # If oscillating or exploding → Bellman target wrong
   ```

   Step 3: Check critic values in reasonable range
   ```python
   print("Critic Q-values range:", q_values.min(), q_values.max())
   # Should be reasonable for rewards (e.g., if rewards [0,1], Q in [0,10])
   ```

   Step 4: Check target network updates
   ```python
   # Are targets being updated?
   print("Target weight change:", (target_param - old_target_param).abs().mean())
   ```

   Step 5: Check advantage variance
   ```python
   print("Advantage std:", advantages.std())
   # If < 0.01, critic might be too accurate (unusual)
   ```

2. **Root Cause Categories**:
   - **Critic divergence** (50% of instability): Wrong Bellman, no gradient clipping
   - **Entropy tuning broken** (30% SAC): α not optimized or wrong target_entropy
   - **Target network stale** (15%): Not updated or update too infrequent
   - **Learning rate too high** (10%): Overshooting during updates
   - **Gradient explosion** (5%): No clipping, huge network outputs

3. **Quick Diagnostic Tests**:
   Test 1: Reduce critic learning rate 10x → If stable, learning rate too high
   Test 2: Add gradient clipping → If stable, gradients exploding
   Test 3: Check Bellman target manually → If wrong, fix immediately
   Test 4: Hard reset target networks (copy exact) → If stable, soft update parameters wrong

4. **Advanced Diagnosis**:
   - Log full critic loss history, plot to find when divergence starts
   - Check if actor or critic diverges first (critic usually culprit)
   - Monitor entropy coefficient (SAC) - should change over time
   - Check action output distribution - should have variance

5. **Prevention Checklist**:
   - [ ] Gradient clipping applied (max_norm = 10 typical)
   - [ ] Reward normalized to ~N(0,1)
   - [ ] Critic Bellman target checked manually
   - [ ] Target network updates happening (verify code)
   - [ ] Learning rates reasonable (1e-4 to 1e-3)
   - [ ] Network initialization not extreme

**Result**: User can diagnose instability systematically, fix root causes instead of symptoms.

## Pressure Scenario 4: SAC vs TD3 Choice Under Uncertainty

**Scenario**: User has two candidate algorithms (SAC and TD3), limited compute budget. Needs to choose which to implement. Doesn't have time to implement both.

**Pressure**:
- Papers say "both SOTA for continuous control"
- User needs to commit to one implementation
- Different hyperparameters for each
- Switching later is costly

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Rigorous Comparison Framework**:

   | Dimension | SAC | TD3 | Winner |
   |-----------|-----|-----|--------|
   | **Exploration** | Auto-tuned entropy | Manual target noise | SAC (automatic) |
   | **Hyperparameters** | α target only | policy_delay, noise, noise_clip | SAC (fewer) |
   | **Sample Efficiency** | Very high (two critics) | Very high (two critics) | Tie |
   | **Computation** | Higher (entropy loss) | Slightly lower | TD3 |
   | **Stability** | Excellent (entropy helps) | Good (three tricks) | SAC |
   | **Determinism** | Stochastic policy | Deterministic policy | Problem-dependent |
   | **Tuning Required** | Minimal (α auto-tuned) | Moderate (policy_delay) | SAC |
   | **Learning Curve** | Steeper (entropy concept) | Shorter (intuitive tricks) | TD3 |
   | **Production Ready** | Yes (auto-tuned) | Yes (proven) | SAC |

2. **Decision Framework Based on Problem Properties**:

   **Choose SAC if**:
   - First time using actor-critic (more robust)
   - Sample efficiency critical (limited data)
   - Want minimal manual tuning
   - Continuous control without determinism requirement
   - Medium-to-complex exploration needed

   **Choose TD3 if**:
   - Deterministic policy explicitly required
   - Have tuning expertise (policy_delay values)
   - Prefer simpler conceptual model (three tricks > entropy maximization)
   - Computation budget tight
   - Prefer established baseline (DDPG variants well-studied)

3. **Empirical Recommendations**:
   Based on OpenAI/DeepMind continuous control benchmarks:
   - SAC typically 10-30% better sample efficiency (due to entropy exploration)
   - TD3 has lower variance between runs (deterministic helps stability)
   - Both converge to similar final performance on well-tuned problems
   - SAC faster overall due to sample efficiency

4. **Risk Assessment**:

   **SAC Risks**:
   - Auto-tuning can break if entropy loss buggy
   - Target entropy must be set correctly (-action_dim)
   - Log probability computation complex (tanh Jacobian needed)

   **TD3 Risks**:
   - Policy delay wrong → actor chases moving target
   - Target policy noise wrong → exploration insufficient or too high
   - Two critics easy to forget (hard to debug one-critic results)

5. **Recommendation**:
   **Start with SAC unless**:
   - Deterministic policy explicitly needed (physical actuator constraints)
   - Very simple exploration (no complex entropy needed)
   - Proven code exists (switch to TD3 if SAC has issues)

   **Why SAC Default**:
   - Auto-tuning = fewer failure modes
   - Higher sample efficiency = faster iteration
   - More modern = better research backing

6. **Implementation Path**:
   If choosing SAC:
   ```
   Week 1: Implement basic SAC (actor, critics, entropy)
   Week 2: Debug auto-tuning (target_entropy, log(α))
   Week 3: Tune learning rates, verify convergence
   Week 4: Deploy
   ```

   If choosing TD3:
   ```
   Week 1: Implement TD3 (actor, critics, policy delay)
   Week 2: Tune policy_delay, target_policy_noise
   Week 3: Verify three tricks working
   Week 4: Deploy
   ```

**Result**: User makes principled algorithm choice based on problem properties and constraints.

## Pressure Scenario 5: Debugging Continuous Action Squashing

**Scenario**: User gets policy gradient from SAC actor, but magnitude seems wrong. Training slow. Suspects tanh squashing is affecting gradients but unsure how.

**Pressure**:
- Complex math (Jacobian of tanh)
- Not obvious from network output that there's a problem
- Gradient flow hard to visualize
- Affects both policy loss and entropy loss

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **The Problem Explained Clearly**:
   ```
   Raw network output: x ∈ ℝ (unbounded)
   Squashed: a = tanh(x) ∈ [-1,1] (bounded)

   Policy probability WRONG:
   π(a|s) = N(μ(s), σ(s))  [Ignores squashing transformation]

   Policy probability RIGHT:
   π(a|s) = |∂a/∂x|^(-1) * N(μ(s), σ(s))  [Jacobian correction]

   The Jacobian factor: |∂tanh(x)/∂x| = 1 - tanh²(x) = 1 - a²
   ```

2. **Why This Matters for SAC**:
   ```
   Wrong entropy calculation → wrong entropy constraint
   → α adjusts based on wrong entropy
   → exploration becomes misaligned
   ```

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Step 1: Sample from normal distribution
   dist = Normal(mu, sigma)
   raw_action = dist.rsample()

   # Step 2: Apply tanh squashing
   action = torch.tanh(raw_action)

   # Step 3: Compute log probability with Jacobian
   log_prob_raw = dist.log_prob(raw_action)
   log_det_jacobian = torch.log(1 - action.pow(2) + 1e-6)
   log_prob = log_prob_raw - log_det_jacobian.sum(dim=-1)

   # Now use log_prob for entropy, policy loss, etc.
   ```

4. **Debugging Checklist**:
   - [ ] Are actions being squashed with tanh?
   - [ ] Is Jacobian term in log_prob computation?
   - [ ] Is log_prob used for entropy (not just action sampling)?
   - [ ] Does entropy computation include squashing adjustment?
   - [ ] For policy loss: Use log_prob with Jacobian?

5. **Common Mistakes**:
   - Computing log_prob from unsquashed distribution (missing Jacobian)
   - Not including Jacobian in entropy calculation (SAC entropy wrong)
   - Scaling actions after squashing without adjusting log_prob

6. **Verification Test**:
   ```python
   # Check that entropy decreases over time (policy becomes more deterministic)
   entropy_values = [-log_prob.mean() for _ in training]
   # Should be: [High → Low] as policy improves

   # If entropy stays constant or explodes → entropy calculation broken
   ```

**Result**: User understands tanh squashing mathematics, implements correctly, training stabilizes.

## Pressure Scenario 6: Network Architecture and Training Dynamics

**Scenario**: User has working actor-critic but uses different network sizes for actor/critic. Actor: 128 hidden. Critic: 512 hidden. Training slow. Asks if architecture mismatch matters.

**Pressure**:
- User has working code
- Change feels risky
- No obvious bugs, just slow
- Unclear why architecture matters

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Why Architecture Matching Matters**:
   - Actor and critic need similar learning speeds
   - If critic much larger, learns faster, actor's advantage estimates improve slowly
   - If actor much larger, learns faster, critic can't keep up (feedback problem)

2. **Specific Guidance**:
   ```python
   # GOOD PRACTICE - similar layer sizes
   actor = [256, 256, action_dim*2]
   critic = [256, 256, 1]
   # Same base representation power

   # BETTER - share initial layers
   shared = [256, 256]
   actor_head = [action_dim*2]  # Or larger for stochastic
   critic_head = [1]

   # NOT IDEAL - mismatched
   actor = [128]  # Too small
   critic = [512]  # Too large
   ```

3. **Why Shared Representations Help**:
   ```
   Shared layers learn general state representation
   Actor: Policy from shared representation
   Critic: Value from shared representation
   Result: Both use same understanding of state, consistent learning
   ```

4. **Empirical Guidance**:
   - Hidden layers: 256-512 typical for continuous control
   - Critic inputs: state + action (concatenate)
   - Actor outputs: mean and log_std (2*action_dim)
   - Depth: 2-3 hidden layers typical

5. **Debugging Slow Training**:
   - Check if critic loss decreases (should be fastest)
   - Check if actor loss decreases (depends on critic)
   - Check if learning rates appropriate (adjust critic_lr if too slow)
   - Check if advantage estimates have variance (if not, critic too accurate somehow)

**Result**: User understands architectural principles, can optimize for performance.

## Pressure Scenario 7: Hyperparameter Sensitivity

**Scenario**: User's SAC works on one environment but fails on similar environment. Different reward scale. Needs to know which hyperparameters to adjust and in what order.

**Pressure**:
- Multiple hyperparameters (learning rates, network sizes, entropy target)
- Blind tuning leads to exponential search space
- Different environments need different settings
- User frustrated by sensitivity

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Ranking** (for SAC):

   **Tier 1 - Most Sensitive** (Adjust first):
   - Critic learning rate (1e-4 to 1e-3)
   - Actor learning rate (1e-4 to 1e-3, typically lower than critic)
   - Reward scale/normalization (CRITICAL)

   **Tier 2 - Important** (Adjust second):
   - Network hidden layer sizes (128 to 512)
   - Entropy target (usually -action_dim, sometimes -action_dim/2)
   - Replay buffer size (10k to 1M)

   **Tier 3 - Moderate** (Fine-tune last):
   - Soft update τ (typically 0.005, can vary 0.001-0.01)
   - Batch size (64-256 typical)
   - GAE λ (0.95-0.99, rarely tuned)

   **Tier 4 - Rarely Changed**:
   - gamma discount (0.99 or 0.999)
   - Initial exploration (handled by entropy)

2. **Diagnostic Approach for New Environment**:

   Step 1: Check reward scale
   ```python
   print("Reward statistics:")
   print("  Mean:", rewards.mean())
   print("  Std:", rewards.std())
   print("  Min/Max:", rewards.min(), rewards.max())
   # If std >> 1 or mean >> 1, normalize
   ```

   Step 2: Try standard hyperparameters first
   ```python
   actor_lr = 1e-4
   critic_lr = 3e-4
   entropy_target = -action_dim
   ```

   Step 3: If training slow, increase learning rates
   Step 4: If training diverges, decrease learning rates
   Step 5: If exploration insufficient, check entropy_target

3. **Adaptive Tuning Strategy**:
   ```
   Start with defaults
   Train for 10k steps, check return trend

   If return increasing → parameters OK
   If return flat → increase learning rates
   If return oscillates → decrease learning rates
   If exploration poor → check entropy coefficient

   Tune one parameter at a time, measure effect
   ```

4. **Transfer Between Environments**:
   - Keep actor_lr, critic_lr, network size constant
   - Adjust only: reward normalization, entropy_target
   - Most hyperparameters are general-purpose

**Result**: User has systematic tuning approach, can transfer knowledge between environments.

## Pressure Scenario 8: Production Deployment Considerations

**Scenario**: User has working actor-critic in research code. Needs to deploy to real robot. Asks about reliability, reproducibility, and edge cases.

**Pressure**:
- Research code != production code
- Real robot has constraints (safety, determinism)
- Edge cases not tested in simulation
- Performance must be stable

**Skill Pressure Test - Demonstrates**:

1. **Determinism for Reproducibility**:
   ```python
   # Set all seeds
   torch.manual_seed(seed)
   np.random.seed(seed)
   env.seed(seed)
   torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True

   # Use deterministic algorithms
   if torch.cuda.is_available():
       torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)
   ```

2. **Safety for Real Robots**:
   ```python
   # Bound actions strictly
   action = torch.clamp(action, action_min, action_max)

   # Check for NaN/Inf
   if torch.isnan(action).any():
       action = safe_default_action

   # Smoothing for stochastic policy
   action = alpha * current_action + (1-alpha) * action
   # Prevents jerky movements from stochastic policy
   ```

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Log action output distribution (mean, std)
   - Log critic Q-values (check for explosion)
   - Log entropy coefficient (SAC, should be stable)
   - Log return over episodes
   - Alert if values go out of expected range

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   ```python
   try:
       action = actor(state)
   except:
       # Network error, use safe default
       action = last_safe_action
   ```

5. **Testing Before Deployment**:
   - Verify reproducibility (same seed → same trajectory)
   - Test edge cases (empty batch, extreme states, etc.)
   - Verify action bounds (never exceed limits)
   - Test network output ranges (log_std not NaN, etc.)

**Result**: User knows how to deploy actor-critic safely and reliably.

## Rationalization and Red Flags Comprehensive Reference

### Common Rationalization Mistakes

**Mistake #1: "My critic loss is negative, something's wrong"**
Reality: Critic loss is MSE (always >= 0). If you see negative values, you might be looking at something else (Q-values are fine to be negative). Check your code.

**Mistake #2: "SAC should be better on all problems"**
Reality: SAC typically better but not always. Deterministic policy (TD3) can be better when:
- Determinism explicitly required (hardware constraints)
- Exploration already handled (curriculum learning)
- Simple, predictable environment

**Mistake #3: "More critics are always better"**
Reality: Two critics (SAC/TD3) is standard. Three+ critics don't help (only waste computation). The minimum of two prevents overestimation; more doesn't help.

**Mistake #4: "Target networks can update every step"**
Reality: Too frequent updates make targets move too quickly. Soft update (τ=0.005) means target changes 0.5% per step. That's appropriate. Faster (τ>0.1) → moving target problem. Slower (τ<0.001) → stale targets.

**Mistake #5: "Larger networks are always better"**
Reality: Diminishing returns beyond 256-512 hidden units for continuous control. Larger networks need more data and longer training. Size 256-512 is sweet spot.

## Red Flags Comprehensive List

| Red Flag | Cause | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Critic loss NaN after 1000 steps | Exploding gradients | Add gradient clipping |
| Critic values >> environment rewards | Wrong Bellman target | Check r + γV(s') formula |
| Actor loss 0 (constant) | Gradients not flowing | Check detach in targets |
| Policy std clamped to min | Network stuck | Check initialization |
| Return increases then crashes | Entropy coefficient broken | Check auto-tuning (SAC) |
| TD3 diverges despite two critics | Target policy smoothing broken | Check noise added to target action |
| Same action always | Policy has no variance | Increase log_std_max |
| Advantage estimates all zero | Critic too accurate (impossible) | Check critic computation |
| Training slow (loss decreasing, return not) | Learning rate too low or network too small | Increase learning rate or hidden units |
| Off-policy divergence | Data too stale from replay | Increase actor learning rate |
