# GREEN: Offline RL Skill Verification

## Overview

This document verifies that the offline-rl skill successfully addresses all RED failures and teaches comprehensive offline RL knowledge.

## RED Failure Resolution

### Failure 1: Using Online Algorithms on Offline Data ✅

**RED Scenario**: User tries Q-learning on offline dataset, gets overestimation.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Section 1**: Explains extrapolation problem with concrete discrete MDP example
- **Part 2 (CQL)**: Explicitly teaches why max_a' Q(s',a') fails
- **Implementation**: Shows CQL penalty that directly prevents extrapolation
- **Key Quote**: "Without environment interaction, errors compound without bound"

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Q-learning should work, max operator finds best actions"
AFTER: "max operator picks hallucinated values offline. Need conservative Q."
```

### Failure 2: Not Understanding Distribution Shift ✅

**RED Scenario**: Policy diverges from data, Q-values become unreliable.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 1**: Full section "Distribution Shift and Policy Divergence" with robot example
- **Part 5**: Dedicated section on distribution shift in offline evaluation
- **Section 8**: Real-world case study shows distribution shift in recommendations
- **Diagnostic**: Includes KL divergence check for policy divergence monitoring

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Diverse data means policy can safely diverge"
AFTER: "Even diverse data has gaps. Monitor KL divergence."
```

### Failure 3: Ignoring Value Overestimation as Core Problem ✅

**RED Scenario**: User applies regularization, misses overestimation issue.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 1**: "Value Overestimation: The Central Problem" explains why TD updates diverge
- **Explanation**: Shows online vs offline correction mechanisms side-by-side
- **Visual**: TD update diagrams showing where feedback diverges
- **Pitfall #1**: Explicitly calls out this misconception

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Just use regularization, that solves offline RL"
AFTER: "Regularization helps, but core problem is value drift. Need conservative targets."
```

### Failure 4: Confusing Offline RL with Supervised Learning ✅

**RED Scenario**: User tries behavior cloning, can't improve.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 1**: "Key Difference from Supervised Learning" contrasts BC vs offline RL
- **Explanation**: Shows BC learns data distribution, offline RL uses rewards for improvement
- **Example**: Chess case study showing why BC fails on suboptimal data
- **Pitfall #6**: Batch constraints section shows BC + offline RL combination

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Offline RL is like supervised learning with rewards"
AFTER: "Offline RL must solve credit assignment + policy improvement under distribution shift"
```

### Failure 5: Using Wrong Algorithm Without Understanding When ✅

**RED Scenario**: User applies CQL everywhere, doesn't adapt to data quality.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 2**: CQL section with when it works (short horizons, diverse data)
- **Part 3**: IQL section with when it excels (high-dim observations, mixed data)
- **Part 4**: BCQ section with when appropriate (limited data, safety-critical)
- **Section 9**: Algorithm variants and function approximation handling
- **Pitfall #5**: Discusses conservatism tuning to data quality

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "CQL solves offline RL, use it everywhere"
AFTER: "CQL for diverse data, IQL for high-dims, BCQ for very limited data"
```

### Failure 6: Improper Offline Evaluation ✅

**RED Scenario**: User runs learned policy in environment to evaluate.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 5**: Full section on offline evaluation without environment interaction
- **Method 1**: Importance sampling with explanation
- **Method 2**: Regression IS to reduce variance
- **Method 3**: Model-based estimation
- **Pitfall #4**: Evaluating offline policies with online metrics (red flag)

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "I'll just run the policy to evaluate it"
AFTER: "Use IS, RIS, or model-based offline metrics. Running defeats offline RL purpose."
```

### Failure 7: Misunderstanding When Offline RL Needed ✅

**RED Scenario**: User applies offline RL to Atari with perfect simulator.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 6**: Decision framework with questions (can you collect? is it expensive? dangerous?)
- **When Essential**: Real robotics, medical, recommendations with cost analysis
- **When Better**: Simulation available, self-play, high fidelity sims
- **Cost-Benefit**: Discusses sample vs compute tradeoffs

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "I have a dataset, so offline RL is needed"
AFTER: "Offline RL only if data expensive/dangerous. Simulation? Use online."
```

### Failure 8: Not Handling Batch Constraints ✅

**RED Scenario**: Policy gradient moves arbitrarily far from behavior policy.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Part 4 (BCQ)**: Entire section on batch constraints
- **Implementation**: Shows perturbation network that stays close to β
- **Pitfall #6**: Explicitly calls out forgetting batch constraints
- **Policy Improvement**: Shows how constraints limit exploration

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "CQL conservative values solves distribution shift"
AFTER: "CQL + behavior constraints both needed. CQL for values, KL for policy."
```

### Failure 9: Assuming Stationary Environment ✅

**RED Scenario**: Environment changes, offline estimate doesn't catch it.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Pitfall #9**: Non-stationary environments red flag
- **Case Study 3**: Medical policy shows continuous retraining needed
- **Diagnostic**: Shows offline vs online performance gap analysis
- **Solution**: Monitor deployment performance vs offline estimate

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Once trained, policy works forever"
AFTER: "Validate offline metrics match reality. Retrain on new data."
```

### Failure 10: Not Accounting for Reward Uncertainty ✅

**RED Scenario**: Sparse/noisy rewards cause Q-estimate uncertainty.

**SKILL Resolution**:
- **Pitfall #10**: Reward uncertainty red flag and solutions
- **Solution**: Ensemble Q-networks for uncertainty estimation
- **Conservative Averaging**: Use min over ensemble
- **Case Study 2**: Medical policy handles sparse rewards naturally with IQL expectile

**Learner Transformation**:
```
BEFORE: "Rewards are fixed, training is deterministic"
AFTER: "Sparse rewards = uncertainty. Use ensembles, min operator."
```
