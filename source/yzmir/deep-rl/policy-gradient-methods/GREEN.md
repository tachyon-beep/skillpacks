Status: Skill implementation complete

## Overview

The policy-gradient-methods skill provides comprehensive, practical guidance on direct policy optimization techniques. The skill addresses the fundamental approach difference from value-based methods: directly optimizing the policy through gradient ascent on expected return rather than learning action values.

## Skill Architecture

The skill is organized in 11 parts building progressive understanding:

### Part 1: Policy Gradient Theorem Foundation
Establishes the mathematical foundation: `∇_θ J(θ) = E[∇_θ log π(a|s,θ) Q^π(s,a)]`

**Key insight**: The log-probability gradient (score function) enables differentiation through stochastic policy. Without log, the gradient is biased. This is the foundation enabling policy gradient methods.

### Part 2: REINFORCE - Vanilla Policy Gradient
Introduces the simplest algorithm as baseline for understanding and shows why it fails in practice.

**Pattern**: REINFORCE demonstrates high variance problem:
- Vanilla REINFORCE uses full Monte Carlo returns
- Gradient updates extremely noisy
- Learning very slow for practical problems
- This establishes motivation for variance reduction

### Part 3: Baseline and Advantage Estimation
Solves high variance through baseline (value function).

**Pattern**: Advantage captures relative action quality
- Baseline b(s) reduces variance without affecting policy (0-gradient in expectation)
- Advantage A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s) measures how much better/worse action is vs expected
- Normalized advantages critical: `(A - mean) / (std + ε)`
- This is the key variance reduction technique

### Part 4: PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization
Introduces practical standard algorithm with clipping mechanism.

**Pattern**: Trust region via clipping
- Probability ratio r = π_new / π_old measures how much policy changed
- Clipping bounds ratio by [1-ε, 1+ε] prevents large updates
- This approximates TRPO's KL constraint constraint much more simply
- PPO is current production standard

### Part 5: TRPO vs PPO
Provides context for why PPO dominates over TRPO.

**Pattern**: Second-order vs first-order optimization
- TRPO uses Fisher information matrix + conjugate gradient (theoretically sound, complex)
- PPO uses simple clipping (approximates trust region, much simpler)
- PPO achieves ~95% of TRPO performance with 10% complexity
- This explains practical algorithm choices

### Part 6: When to Use vs Value Methods
Decision framework for algorithm selection.

**Pattern**: Structure determines algorithm
- Continuous actions → Policy gradients (can't enumerate infinite actions)
- Discrete actions → Value methods or policy gradients (can enumerate)
- Stochastic policy required → Policy gradients naturally stochastic
- Value space vs policy space complexity → Choose based on learning difficulty

### Part 7: Common Pitfalls and Debugging
Systematic debugging and red flags.

**Pattern**: Each pitfall has root cause and systematic fix
- High variance → Missing baseline or unnormalized advantages
- Training instability → Learning rate too high, wrong clip ratio, unnormalized advantages
- Gradient vanishing → Policy too deterministic, need entropy bonus
- Credit assignment failure → Need GAE for long horizons
- Reward scale → Affects learning dynamics, needs normalization/clipping

### Part 8: Discrete vs Continuous Actions
Implementation details for action space handling.

**Pattern**: Fundamentally different network outputs
- Discrete: softmax over action logits (categorical distribution)
- Continuous: Gaussian with mean and std parameters
- Log-probability computation differs (softmax vs Gaussian)
- But loss computation (policy gradient) identical in structure

### Part 9: Implementation Pitfalls Table
Quick reference for symptom→root cause→fix.

**Pattern**: Systematic mapping of problems to solutions
- 8 major pitfalls with clear symptoms and solutions
- Helps diagnose issues without deep debugging
- Red flags for early warning signs

### Part 10: Testing Scenarios (13+)
Comprehensive test cases covering algorithm variations and edge cases.

**Pattern**: Coverage of algorithm breadth and depth
- Basic algorithms (REINFORCE, PPO)
- Variants (continuous, discrete)
- Ablations (baseline, normalization, batch size)
- Comparisons (different learning approaches)
- Edge cases (long horizon, scaling issues)

### Part 11: Rationalization Table
Addresses common misconceptions users bring.

**Pattern**: User claim → Why it's rationalization → Correct approach
- Addresses fundamental confusion (continuous→DQN)
- Algorithm sophistication confusion (TRPO>PPO)
- Hyperparameter misconceptions (bigger batch/clip always better)
- Addresses trust region and exploration confusion

## Key Patterns Established

### Pattern 1: Variance Reduction Progression
```
REINFORCE (vanilla)
    ↓ [high variance problem]
REINFORCE + Baseline (value network)
    ↓ [still has variance from advantage estimation]
REINFORCE + Baseline + Normalization (standardize advantages)
    ↓ [stable but sample inefficient]
PPO (clipping prevents large updates)
    ↓ [practical production algorithm]
TRPO (theoretical optimality)
```

This progression shows how each technique addresses a specific variance/stability problem.

### Pattern 2: The Trust Region Concept
All modern policy gradients enforce trust regions (prevent large policy changes per step):
- REINFORCE: No trust region (high variance)
- REINFORCE+Baseline: Implicit via learning rate
- PPO: Explicit via clipping
- TRPO: Explicit via KL divergence constraint

PPO's clipping is approximate but vastly simpler than TRPO's optimization.

### Pattern 3: Advantage Normalization is Critical
Appears in multiple contexts:
- Raw advantages vary widely ([-1000, 1000])
- Normalized advantages stable ([−2, 2])
- This determines learning stability directly
- Not a suggestion, prerequisite for training

### Pattern 4: Discrete vs Continuous is Fundamental Difference
Not a minor implementation detail:
- Discrete: softmax (categorical distribution)
- Continuous: Gaussian (normal distribution)
- Log-probability computation completely different
- But loss function structure identical

### Pattern 5: Algorithm Selection Based on Action Space Structure
- Infinite continuous action space → Must use policy gradients
- Small discrete action space → Can use value methods efficiently
- But policy gradients work for both
- Practical: choose based on action space, not personal preference

### Pattern 6: Debugging via Root Cause Analysis
Each symptom maps to systematic root causes:
- Training noisy → baseline missing
- Unstable → advantage normalization, LR, clip ratio
- Slow → variance reduction or hyperparameters
- Stopped → entropy/exploration loss

This prevents random hyperparameter tuning.

## Design Choices

### Why REINFORCE First?
REINFORCE is the simplest policy gradient algorithm. Starting with it:
- Shows the core idea (policy gradient theorem in practice)
- Demonstrates high variance problem
- Motivates baseline/advantage need
- Provides foundation for understanding PPO

Without understanding REINFORCE's limitations, users don't understand why PPO exists.

### Why PPO Over TRPO?
TRPO is theoretically superior but impractical:
- TRPO requires Fisher matrix computation (O(n²) memory, expensive)
- Requires conjugate gradient optimization (complex to implement)
- PPO's clipping approximates trust region with 1 line of code

PPO dominates practice because it achieves ~95% effectiveness with 10% complexity.

### Why Emphasis on Advantage Normalization?
Most policy gradient bugs trace to unnormalized advantages:
- Raw advantages vary widely: [-1000, 1000]
- Creates gradient explosion/vanishing
- Simple fix: standardize to zero mean, unit variance
- Not optional, prerequisite

### Why Discrete vs Continuous Comparison?
Policy gradients work for both, but implementation details differ:
- Different network outputs (softmax vs Gaussian parameters)
- Different log-probability computation
- Users frequently confuse these
- Including both avoids hard-to-debug mistakes
