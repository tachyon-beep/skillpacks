# policy-gradient-methods - REFACTOR Phase Results

Date: 2025-10-30
Status: Pressure testing complete - 6 scenarios verified

## Overview

REFACTOR phase tests the skill under pressure: challenging user requests, conflicting constraints, common rationalizations, and boundary conditions. These scenarios ensure the skill robustly handles expert users, misguided approaches, and edge cases.

---

## Scenario 1: Expert User Wants Vanilla REINFORCE

**Setup**: User is researcher who specifically wants REINFORCE (not PPO) for theoretical exploration.

**Pressure**: "I understand PPO is practical but I want vanilla REINFORCE to study policy gradient behavior. Stop telling me to use PPO, just help me implement clean REINFORCE."

**Skill Response Required**:
- Acknowledge legitimate use case (research/education)
- Provide clean REINFORCE implementation
- But explain variance issues they'll face
- Help with variance reduction *if* they want (baseline, entropy)
- Set expectations: REINFORCE slower than PPO by design

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 2 provides REINFORCE implementation
- Part 3 explains baseline as *optional enhancement* not requirement
- Acknowledges REINFORCE as foundation for understanding
- Doesn't force PPO, but makes trade-offs clear

**Robustness**: Skill respects legitimate research use case while making real constraints clear. User can make informed choice.

---

## Scenario 2: PPO Not Learning - User Wants Systematic Debugging

**Setup**: User has PPO implementation that compiles but doesn't learn (rewards flat, not increasing).

**Pressure**: "I've followed tutorials, my implementation looks right, but it's not learning. Walk me through systematic debugging without just saying 'tune hyperparameters'."

**Conflicting Approaches**:
- Quick fix: "Try different learning rate"
- Skill approach: Systematic root cause analysis

**Skill Response Required**:
- Provide debugging checklist (not guessing)
- Help identify whether problem is:
  - Advantage normalization (most common)
  - Baseline quality (value network not learning)
  - Learning rate/clip ratio (stability)
  - Reward scaling (gradient magnitude)
- Give specific tests for each

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 7 provides systematic pitfall→root cause→fix
- Pitfalls table gives diagnostic approach
- Example: "If loss oscillates → advantage normalization likely"
- Provides specific fixes with code examples

**Verification**:
```python
# Skill teaches systematic debugging:
1. Check advantage statistics (should be ~0 mean after norm)
2. Check policy ratio statistics (should be ~1.0 on well-trained)
3. Check value loss separately (should decrease)
4. Check gradient magnitudes (should not be tiny or huge)
5. Check entropy (should not approach zero)
```

## Scenario 3: Continuous Control Problem - Agent Overexploits

**Setup**: User has continuous control task (robot arm). PPO implementation works but policy becomes too deterministic, gets stuck in local optimum.

**Pressure**: "My robot learns a solution but it's sub-optimal and doesn't explore. Adding entropy bonus helps temporarily but then converges to deterministic anyway. Is this fundamental to policy gradients?"

**Challenge**: Balancing exploration vs exploitation in continuous control.

**Conflicting Intuitions**:
- "Higher entropy coefficient always better" ← Wrong (can prevent convergence)
- "Deterministic policy is goal" ← Wrong (exploration important)
- "Just increase policy std" ← Wrong (why std is decreasing in first place)

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain entropy bonus prevents but doesn't solve root cause
- Help diagnose: is policy actually learning or getting stuck?
- Provide principled approaches:
  - Entropy coefficient tuning (0.001-0.1)
  - Minimum std enforcement
  - Curriculum learning (easier tasks first)
  - Better reward shaping

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 7 addresses "Vanishing Gradients with Small Variance" pitfall
- Explains why policy converges to deterministic
- Provides entropy bonus solution: `-0.01 * entropy`
- Provides minimum std solution: `log_std = clamp(log_std, min=-20)`
- Explains this is normal behavior, not fundamental limitation

**Advanced Response**:
```python
# Skill provides progressive solutions:

# Option 1: Entropy bonus (encourages exploration)
entropy = 0.5 * torch.sum(torch.log(2 * torch.pi * torch.e * std))
loss = policy_loss - 0.01 * entropy  # Adjust 0.01 for your task

# Option 2: Minimum std constraint (hard lower bound)
log_std = torch.clamp(log_std, min=-20)  # Prevent std→0

# Option 3: Reward shaping (make exploration valuable)
# Add bonus for trying different actions
```

## Scenario 4: Discrete Action Space - Unexpected PPO Failure

**Setup**: User has discrete action space (4 actions) with PPO. Training works for simple environment but fails on slightly more complex task.

**Pressure**: "PPO works on CartPole but fails on LunarLander (slightly harder). Same hyperparameters. Is PPO not suitable for this?"

**Misconception**: Algorithm is universal, hyperparameters are not.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain PPO algorithm is same, but hyperparameters must change
- Help with principled hyperparameter adjustment:
  - Batch size (larger for more complex)
  - Learning rate (might need decay)
  - Clip ratio (0.2 standard but can adjust)
  - Entropy coefficient (problem-dependent)
  - Value loss weight

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 4 explains PPO implementation has multiple hyperparameters
- Part 7 discusses learning rate, batch size, entropy
- Rationalization table addresses "Algorithm sophistication ≠ effectiveness"
- Provides principled tuning approach

**Systematic Response**:
```python
# Skill teaches systematic hyperparameter search:

# Step 1: Verify basics
assert batch_size >= 256  # Stability requirement
assert lr in [0.0003, 0.001, 0.0005]  # Reasonable range
assert clip_ratio == 0.2  # Start with standard

# Step 2: Increase data for harder problems
if task_difficulty == "harder":
    batch_size *= 2  # More stability
    num_epochs *= 2  # More updates per batch

# Step 3: Tune per-task (not guessing)
hyperparams_to_try = {
    'entropy_coeff': [0.0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    'value_loss_coeff': [0.5, 1.0, 2.0],
    'learning_rate': [0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001]
}

# Grid search or random search over these
```

## Scenario 5: Confusing Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic

**Setup**: User is confused whether skill they need is policy-gradient-methods or actor-critic-methods.

**Pressure**: "Both seem to use a policy network. What's the difference? Should I be using actor-critic instead?"

**Core Confusion**: Both use policy gradient, but actor-critic adds value network as baseline.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Clarify: policy-gradient-methods is foundation
- Actor-critic = policy gradient + baseline (systematic combination)
- Both invoke this skill but different routing:
  - policy-gradient-methods: When asking about REINFORCE, PPO, basic policy gradients
  - actor-critic-methods: When asking about A3C, A2C, advanced actor-critic algorithms

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Skill explicitly covers baselines (Part 3) which are core to actor-critic
- Includes policy gradient with value network (baseline)
- Doesn't try to be actor-critic-methods skill
- Clear routing: "use actor-critic-methods for A3C/A2C/advanced"

**Clarification**:
```
Policy Gradients: π(a|s,θ) optimized via policy gradient theorem
├─ REINFORCE: vanilla, high variance
├─ REINFORCE+Baseline: add value function for variance reduction
├─ PPO: add clipping for stability
└─ This skill covers all above

Actor-Critic: Systematic combination of policy and value learning
├─ A2C: asynchronous parallel updates
├─ A3C: distributed actor-critic
├─ Advanced variants (IMPALA, etc.)
└─ Separate skill for these
```

## Scenario 6: Long Horizon Problem - Credit Assignment Failure

**Setup**: User has long-horizon task (200+ step episodes). Policy learns some behaviors but not smooth progression. Early steps seem unaffected by training.

**Pressure**: "My 500-step task shows returns increasing but early steps still random. I'm using Monte Carlo returns. Is policy gradient the wrong choice for long horizons?"

**Misconception**: Algorithm limitation, but actually implementation limitation.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain: long horizon doesn't break policy gradients, but increases variance
- Monte Carlo returns have huge variance over 500 steps
- Solution: GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)
- Provide GAE implementation and explanation

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 7 addresses "Credit Assignment Over Long Horizons" pitfall
- Explains variance from far-future rewards
- Provides GAE implementation with explanation
- Shows why this solves credit assignment

**Technical Response**:
```python
# Problem explanation:
# Monte Carlo return for step 0 depends on 500 future rewards
# Variance explodes: σ² ≈ 500 * σ_reward²
# Gradient signal drowns in noise

# Solution: GAE
def gae(rewards, values, gamma=0.99, lambda_=0.95):
    """
    GAE = weighted average of n-step returns
    λ=0: use only 1-step (TD)
    λ=1: use full Monte Carlo
    λ=0.95: best of both (default)
    """
    advantages = []
    gae_value = 0
    for t in reversed(range(len(rewards))):
        td_residual = rewards[t] + gamma * values[t+1] - values[t]
        gae_value = td_residual + gamma * lambda_ * gae_value
        advantages.insert(0, gae_value)
    return torch.tensor(advantages, dtype=torch.float32)

# This dramatically reduces variance while maintaining credit assignment
```

---

## Scenario 7: Reward Scale Explosion

**Setup**: User's custom environment has rewards in [0, 10000]. Training diverges: loss is NaN, Q-values explode.

**Pressure**: "My rewards are inherently large (10000 for successful episode). Papers only show clipping for Atari. Do I need to redesign my reward function or fix training?"

**Misconception**: Reward scale only matters for Atari, but it's universal.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain: reward scale affects gradient magnitudes directly
- Large rewards → large advantages → huge gradient updates
- Solutions: clipping, normalization, or reward scaling
- Help choose appropriate approach for their task

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 7 addresses "Reward Scale Issues" pitfall
- Explains mechanisms and provides solutions
- Not just Atari-specific, applies to all tasks
- Provides code for running normalization

**Technical Response**:
```python
# Problem:
# Loss = policy_loss - value_loss
# value_loss = (reward - value)^2 where reward ∈ [0, 10000]
# Huge squared errors → huge gradient → divergence

# Solutions (pick one):

# Option 1: Reward clipping (if known range)
reward = np.clip(reward, -1, 1)  # Standard Atari approach

# Option 2: Reward normalization (adaptive)
class RewardNormalizer:
    def normalize(self, reward):
        # Track running mean/std of rewards
        return (reward - mean) / (std + 1e-8)

# Option 3: Scaling factor (simple)
reward = reward / 1000  # Scale to reasonable range

# In general: keep rewards in approximately [-1, 1] range
```

## Scenario 8: User Wants to Combine DQN and Policy Gradients

**Setup**: User has discrete action space, wonders if combining DQN's experience replay with PPO's policy optimization would be better.

**Pressure**: "DQN has efficient experience replay, PPO has stable updates. Why not combine them? Use replay buffer with policy gradients?"

**Misconception**: Mixing algorithms = better performance.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain fundamental difference: on-policy vs off-policy
- Policy gradients use on-policy data (current policy)
- DQN uses off-policy data (any old policy)
- Mixing them breaks variance reduction: advantages invalid for old data
- Why PPO's on-policy approach is actually better for stability

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Explained implicitly throughout
- Part 2-4 focus on on-policy learning
- Rationalization table addresses "Algorithm complexity ≠ effectiveness"
- Could redirect to advanced topics for off-policy policy gradients

**Technical Explanation**:
```
Why PPO is on-policy (can't use replay buffer):

Advantage A_t = r_t + γV(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
                is valid ONLY under current policy

If you replay old data from old policy:
- Advantage estimates based on old policy
- Current policy different → advantage estimates wrong
- Training diverges or converges to wrong policy

This is why importance sampling (correction weights) needed for off-policy.

Standard PPO avoids this by using on-policy data exclusively.
```

## Scenario 9: Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis

**Setup**: User wants to understand how hyperparameters affect PPO performance.

**Pressure**: "You give rules of thumb but I want to understand dependencies. If I double batch size, what exactly changes? Learning rate effect?"

**Advanced User**: Wants principled understanding, not just rules.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain mechanism for each hyperparameter
- Batch size → Affects advantage estimate variance
- Learning rate → Affects update magnitude relative to gradient
- Clip ratio → Controls trust region size
- Entropy → Controls exploration

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Skill provides mechanisms, not just values
- Part 4 explains clip ratio mechanism
- Part 7 explains batch size effect on stability
- Learning rate mechanisms explained in pitfall section

**Mechanistic Response**:
```
Batch Size Effect:
- Larger batch → more accurate advantage estimates
- More stability (less variance in mean, std computations)
- But: diminishing returns > 2048, computational cost
- Tradeoff: stability vs efficiency

Learning Rate Effect:
- θ ← θ + lr * ∇J(θ)
- Larger lr → larger steps, converges faster but unstable
- Smaller lr → stable but slow convergence
- For policy on probability distribution, need conservative lr

Clip Ratio Effect:
- ε = 0.1: tight trust region, conservative updates, slow convergence
- ε = 0.2: standard, balances speed and stability
- ε = 0.5: loose trust region, can diverge if unlucky
- Controls maximum policy KL divergence per step

Entropy Coefficient Effect:
- β = 0: no exploration bonus, converges fast but may find local minima
- β = 0.01: balance exploration and exploitation (standard)
- β = 0.1: heavy exploration, learns slower but more robust
```

## Scenario 10: User Challenges Advantage Normalization Necessity

**Setup**: User implements PPO without advantage normalization, it works (slowly), argues normalization not necessary.

**Pressure**: "My implementation works without normalizing advantages, just using small learning rate. Why do you say it's critical? It's working fine."

**Rationalizing Poor Performance**: Working ≠ Optimal.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Acknowledge it can work (small lr just compensates)
- Quantify cost: how much slower is it?
- Show: with normalization, can use higher lr AND get better results
- Provide A/B comparison

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 3 explains advantage normalization mechanism
- Part 7 shows it as critical pitfall with symptoms
- Skill emphasizes it's not optional, it's prerequisite
- Shows how normalization enables higher learning rates

**Response with Numbers**:
```
Without normalization (working but slow):
- Learning rate must be tiny (0.00001) to avoid divergence
- Training takes 10x samples to convergence
- Very slow, but eventually works

With normalization (standard approach):
- Can use reasonable learning rate (0.0003-0.001)
- Training converges in normal sample budget
- 10x faster with same stability

Difference: Not optional, it's difference between practical and impractical
```

## Scenario 11: Switching Between Discrete and Continuous

**Setup**: User wants to modify their task from discrete to continuous (or vice versa).

**Pressure**: "I have working discrete PPO code. I want to add continuous action space variant. Can I just change the output layer?"

**Misconception**: Only output layer differs.

**Skill Response Required**:
- Explain: discrete and continuous differ in several places
- Output layer different (softmax vs Gaussian parameters)
- Log-probability computation completely different
- Sampling different (categorical vs Gaussian)
- All must change together

**How Skill Handles This**:
- Part 8 provides discrete vs continuous implementation comparison
- Shows both implementations side-by-side
- Highlights differences clearly
- Provides complete working examples for both

**Implementation Guide**:
```
Discrete (Softmax):
1. Output: logits [batch, num_actions]
2. Policy: π(a|s) = softmax(logits)[action]
3. Log-prob: log(softmax(logits)[action])
4. Sample: categorical distribution

Continuous (Gaussian):
1. Output: mean [batch, action_dim], log_std [action_dim]
2. Policy: π(a|s) = N(mean, std)
3. Log-prob: -0.5*(a-μ)²/σ² - 0.5*log(σ²)
4. Sample: Gaussian distribution

Not interchangeable! Must rewrite policy network and log_prob function.
```

2. **Systematic debugging** (not random hyperparameter tuning)
3. **Problem-specific solutions** (entropy, continuous control specifics)
4. **Hyperparameter robustness** (discrete action spaces needing adjustment)
5. **Conceptual confusion** (policy gradient vs actor-critic)
6. **Implementation limitations** (GAE for long horizons)
7. **Reward dynamics** (scaling and normalization)
8. **Algorithm combination misconceptions** (why not mix approaches)
9. **Mechanistic understanding** (not just rules of thumb)
10. **Challenging assumptions** (normalization necessity)
