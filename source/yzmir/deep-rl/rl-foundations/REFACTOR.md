# REFACTOR Phase: RL Foundations Pressure Testing

## Testing Methodology

Test skill under pressure with scenarios designed to trigger rationalization and shortcuts. Skill must resist and guide user to correct understanding.

**Success Criteria**: Skill content provides clear guidance that prevents rationalization in each scenario.

---

## Pressure Test 1: User Wants to Skip Theory

### Scenario
```
User: "I don't need to learn all this theory. Just show me how to implement DQN for my game."
```

### Expected Resistance (from skill)

**Part 1 (MDP Formulation) states**:
> "Without this foundation, you're copy-pasting code you cannot debug, adapt, or extend."

**MDP Formulation Checklist**:
> "Before implementing any RL algorithm, answer:
> - [ ] States: What information defines the situation? Is it Markovian?
> - [ ] Actions: What can the agent do? Discrete or continuous?
> - [ ] Transitions: Deterministic or stochastic? Do you know P(s'|s,a)?
> - [ ] Rewards: Immediate reward for each transition? Sparse or dense?
> - [ ] Discount: Episodic (can use γ=1) or continuing (need γ<1)?
> - [ ] Markov Property: Does current state fully determine future?
> 
> If you cannot answer these, you cannot implement RL algorithms effectively."

**Rationalization Table Entry**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "I'll just copy Q-learning code" | Doesn't understand Q(s,a) meaning, cannot debug | "Let's understand what Q represents: expected cumulative reward. Why does Bellman equation have max?" |

**Red Flag**:
- [ ] **Skipping MDP Formulation**: Implementing algorithm without defining S, A, P, R, γ

**Part 8 (When Theory is Sufficient)**:
> "When Understanding Theory is Enough:
> 1. Debugging: Understanding Bellman equation explains why Q-values aren't converging
> 2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Understanding γ explains why agent is myopic
> 3. Algorithm Selection: Understanding model-free vs model-based explains why value iteration fails
> 4. Conceptual Design: Understanding exploration explains why agent gets stuck"

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Explicit statement that theory is prerequisite
2. Checklist that must be completed before implementation
3. Rationalization resistance ("I'll just copy code" → "You won't be able to debug")
4. Red flag identification
5. Examples of theory enabling debugging

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill resists "skip to code" rationalization

---

## Pressure Test 2: Confusion About Discount Factor (γ=0.9 vs 0.99)

### Scenario
```
User: "My agent only cares about short-term rewards. Should I use gamma=0.9 or 0.99? What's the difference?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 5 (Discount Factor) provides**:

**Planning Horizon Section**:
> "Effective Horizon: How far ahead does agent plan?
> 
> Approximation: Horizon ≈ 1/(1-γ)
> 
> Examples:
> - γ=0.9 → Horizon ≈ 10 steps
> - γ=0.99 → Horizon ≈ 100 steps
> - γ=0.5 → Horizon ≈ 2 steps
> - γ=0.999 → Horizon ≈ 1000 steps"

**Numerical Impact**:
> "Reward 10 steps away:
> - γ=0.9: worth 0.9^10 = 0.35 of immediate reward
> - γ=0.99: worth 0.99^10 = 0.90 of immediate reward"

**Choosing γ**:
> "Rule of Thumb:
> - Task horizon known: γ such that 1/(1-γ) ≈ task_length
> - Short episodes (< 100 steps): γ = 0.9 to 0.95
> - Long episodes (100-1000 steps): γ = 0.99
> - Very long (> 1000 steps): γ = 0.999
> 
> Example: Pong (episode ~ 1000 steps)
> γ = 0.99  # Horizon ≈ 100, sees ~10% of episode"

**Code Example 4**: Full numerical demonstration showing V(s) for different γ values

**Pitfall #1 (Too Small γ)**:
> "Scenario: Task requires 50 steps to reach goal, γ=0.9.
> 
> Problem:
> Reward at step 50 discounted by 0.9^50 = 0.0052
> 
> Effect: Agent effectively blind to long-term goals (can't see reward).
> 
> Solution: Increase γ to 0.99 (0.99^50 = 0.61, still significant)."

**Pitfall #3 (Treating γ as Hyperparameter)**:
> "Wrong Mindset: 'Let's grid search γ in [0.9, 0.95, 0.99].'
> 
> Correct Mindset: 'Task requires planning X steps ahead, so γ = 1 - 1/X.'
> 
> Example: Goal 100 steps away
> Required horizon = 100
> γ = 1 - 1/100 = 0.99"

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Exact formula (horizon = 1/(1-γ))
2. Numerical comparison (0.9 vs 0.99 impact)
3. Task-specific guidelines
4. Concrete examples (Pong, Chess)
5. Code example demonstrating impact
6. Pitfalls showing consequences of wrong choice

**User Can Now**:
- Calculate planning horizon for their task
- Choose appropriate γ based on task length
- Understand numerical impact (not just "bigger is better")

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill provides principled γ choice, not trial-and-error

---

## Pressure Test 3: Not Understanding Why Exploration Needed

### Scenario
```
User: "My Q-learning agent just picks the best action (argmax Q). Why isn't it learning?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 7 (Exploration vs Exploitation)**:

**Why Exploration is Necessary**:
> "Scenario: GridWorld, Q-values initialized to 0.
> 
> Without Exploration:
> ```python
> # Greedy policy
> policy(s) = argmax(Q[s, :])  # Always 0 initially, picks arbitrary action
> ```
> 
> Problem: If first action happens to be BAD, Q[s,a] becomes negative, never tried again.
> 
> Result: Agent stuck in suboptimal policy (local optimum).
> 
> With Exploration:
> ```python
> # ε-greedy
> if random.random() < epsilon:
>     action = random.choice(actions)  # Explore
> else:
>     action = argmax(Q[s, :])  # Exploit
> ```
> 
> Result: Eventually tries all actions, discovers optimal."

**Pitfall #1 (No Exploration)**:
> "Scenario: Pure greedy policy.
> 
> ```python
> action = argmax(Q[state, :])  # No randomness
> ```
> 
> Problem: Agent never explores, gets stuck in local optimum.
> 
> Example: Q-values initialized to 0, first action is UP (arbitrary).
> - Agent always chooses UP (Q still 0 for others)
> - Never discovers RIGHT is optimal
> - Stuck forever
> 
> Solution: Always use some exploration (ε-greedy with ε ≥ 0.01)."

**Code Example 5**: Empirical comparison showing greedy gets 1.05 reward vs ε-greedy gets 4.62 (optimal is 5.0)

**Part 3 (Policy Pitfall #1)**:
> "Problem: Always taking argmax(Q) means never trying new actions.
> 
> Why It Fails: If Q is initialized wrong, agent never explores better actions."

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Concrete example (GridWorld with Q=0 initialization)
2. Step-by-step explanation of failure
3. Comparison with exploration
4. Code showing ε-greedy implementation
5. Empirical demonstration (greedy: 1.05, ε-greedy: 4.62, optimal: 5.0)
6. Pitfall with solution

**User Understands**:
- Why greedy fails (gets stuck on first action)
- How exploration fixes it (tries all actions)
- Numerical impact (4.5x worse performance)

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill clearly explains why exploration is mandatory

---

## Pressure Test 4: Trying to Use Supervised Learning for RL

### Scenario
```
User: "RL seems complicated. Can I just train a neural network to predict Q-values from (state, action) pairs using supervised learning?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 1 (MDP Introduction)**:
> "Reinforcement learning is built on a rigorous mathematical framework:
> 1. MDP (Markov Decision Process) - the framework
> 2. Value Functions - quantify expected return
> 3. Bellman Equations - recursive decomposition
> 4. Optimal Policy - maximize expected return
> 5. Algorithms - methods to find optimal policy"

**Part 2 (Value Function Definition)**:
> "V^π(s) = E_π[G_t | s_t = s]
>        = E_π[r_t + γr_{t+1} + γ²r_{t+2} + ... | s_t = s]
> 
> Meaning: Expected cumulative discounted reward starting from state s and following policy π."

**Part 4 (Bellman Equations)**:
> "Q-Learning Update:
> Q[s,a] += alpha * (r + gamma * max_a' Q[s',a'] - Q[s,a])
> 
> Bootstrapping: Use current estimate Q[s',a'] instead of true return."

**Part 6 (TD Learning)**:
> "TD(0) Update:
> ```python
> V[s] += alpha * (r + gamma * V[s_next] - V[s])
> #                \_____________________/
> #                       TD error
> ```
> 
> Bootstrapping: Use current estimate V[s_next] instead of true return."

**Rationalization Table**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "RL is just supervised learning" | RL has exploration, credit assignment, non-stationarity | "Route to rl-foundations for RL-specific concepts (MDP, exploration)" |

**Key Differences** (implicit in skill):
1. **Supervised learning**: Fixed dataset, labels known
2. **RL**: Interactive, must explore to get data, labels (Q-values) unknown and bootstrapped

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. MDP framework (not in supervised learning)
2. Bellman equation (recursive, not supervised)
3. Bootstrapping explanation (Q[s',a'] is estimate, not label)
4. Exploration requirement (must interact to get data)
5. Rationalization resistance entry

**However**: Skill could be more explicit about supervised vs RL differences.

**Enhancement Needed**: Add section explicitly contrasting supervised learning and RL.

**Verdict**: ⚠ PARTIAL PASS - Skill addresses indirectly, could be more explicit

**Note**: This is acceptable since skill assumes basic ML knowledge. User would route from using-deep-rl meta-skill which would clarify.

## Pressure Test 5: Confusing Value Iteration and Policy Iteration

### Scenario
```
User: "I implemented value iteration but my policy is random. What's wrong?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 6 (Value Iteration)**:
> "Algorithm: Iteratively apply Bellman optimality operator.
> 
> [Full pseudocode provided]
> 
> # Extract policy
> policy = {s: argmax([sum(P(s_next|s,a) * (R(s,a,s_next) + gamma * V[s_next])
>                          for s_next in states)
>                     for a in actions])
>           for s in states}"

**Key Quote**:
> "Convergence: Guaranteed (Bellman operator is contraction).
> 
> When to Use: Small state spaces (< 10,000 states), full model available."

**Part 6 (Policy Iteration)**:
> "Algorithm: Alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement.
> 
> [Full pseudocode provided]
> 
> # Policy Improvement: Make policy greedy w.r.t. V
> policy_stable = True
> for s in states:
>     old_action = policy[s]
>     policy[s] = argmax([sum(P(s_next|s,a) * (R(s,a,s_next) + gamma * V[s_next])
>                            for s_next in states)
>                        for a in actions])
>     if old_action != policy[s]:
>         policy_stable = False"

**Comparison Table**:
| Algorithm | Model? | Episodes? | Convergence | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Value Iteration | Yes (P, R) | No | Guaranteed | Small MDPs, known model |
| Policy Iteration | Yes (P, R) | No | Guaranteed, faster | Small MDPs, good init policy |

**Key Difference Section**:
> "Value iteration: no explicit policy until end
> Policy iteration: maintain and improve policy each iteration"

**Pitfall #4 (RED Phase)**:
> "User doesn't understand algorithmic difference (value iteration extracts policy at end, policy iteration maintains explicit policy)."

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Full pseudocode for both algorithms
2. Explicit policy extraction step in value iteration
3. Comparison table
4. "Key Difference" section
5. When to use each

**User Can Diagnose**:
- Value iteration: Need to extract policy AFTER convergence (argmax)
- Policy iteration: Policy maintained throughout

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill clearly distinguishes algorithms and shows policy extraction

---

## Pressure Test 6: Using Wrong State Representation

### Scenario
```
User: "I'm using single video frame as state for Pong. Agent isn't learning. Why?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 1 (MDP Pitfall #1)**:
> "Using Wrong State Representation
> 
> Bad: State = current frame only (when velocity matters)
> ```python
> # Pong: Ball position alone doesn't tell velocity
> state = current_frame  # WRONG - not Markovian
> ```
> 
> Good: State = last 4 frames (velocity from difference)
> ```python
> # Frame stacking preserves Markov property
> state = np.concatenate([frame_t, frame_{t-1}, frame_{t-2}, frame_{t-3}])
> ```
> 
> Why: Ball velocity = (position_t - position_{t-1}) / dt, need history."

**Part 1 (When is Markov Property Violated?)**:
> "Example: Robot with Noisy Sensors
> 
> State: Raw sensor reading (single frame)
> Markov Violated: True position requires integrating multiple frames
> 
> Solution: Stack frames (last 4 frames as state), or use recurrent network (LSTM)."

**Part 1 (MDP Formulation Checklist)**:
> "- [ ] States: What information defines the situation? Is it Markovian?
> - [ ] Markov Property: Does current state fully determine future?"

**Red Flag**:
- [ ] **Skipping MDP Formulation**: Implementing algorithm without defining S, A, P, R, γ

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Exact scenario (Pong with single frame)
2. Diagnosis (not Markovian - velocity missing)
3. Solution (frame stacking)
4. Mathematical explanation (velocity from difference)
5. Checklist to catch this before implementation

**User Can Fix**:
- Stack last 4 frames
- Understand why (velocity information)
- Generalize to other problems (Markov property check)

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill provides exact diagnosis and solution for this common issue

---

## Pressure Test 7: Arbitrary Hyperparameter Tuning

### Scenario
```
User: "Should I use alpha=0.1 or alpha=0.01? gamma=0.9 or 0.99? epsilon=0.1 or 0.2? Let me grid search all combinations."
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**For γ (Discount Factor)**:

**Part 5 (Choosing γ)**:
> "Rule of Thumb:
> - Task horizon known: γ such that 1/(1-γ) ≈ task_length
> - Short episodes (< 100 steps): γ = 0.9 to 0.95
> - Long episodes (100-1000 steps): γ = 0.99
> - Very long (> 1000 steps): γ = 0.999"

**Pitfall #3**:
> "Wrong Mindset: 'Let's grid search γ in [0.9, 0.95, 0.99].'
> 
> Correct Mindset: 'Task requires planning X steps ahead, so γ = 1 - 1/X.'"

**For α (Learning Rate)**:

**Part 6 (Q-Learning, SARSA)**: Shows alpha in code but doesn't prescribe specific value.

**Part 6 (TD Learning)**:
> "Disadvantages:
> - Biased estimates (bootstrap uses estimate)
> - Requires tuning α (learning rate)"

**For ε (Exploration)**:

**Part 7 (ε-Greedy)**:
> "Tuning ε:
> - ε = 0: No exploration (greedy, can get stuck)
> - ε = 1: Random policy (no exploitation, never converges)
> - ε = 0.1: Common choice (10% exploration)
> 
> Decay Schedule:
> ```python
> epsilon = max(epsilon_min, epsilon * decay_rate)
> # Start high (ε=1.0), decay to low (ε=0.01)
> ```
> 
> Rationale: Explore heavily early, exploit more as you learn."

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:

**For γ**: ✓ Principled choice based on task horizon (not grid search)
**For α**: ⚠ Mentions need for tuning but doesn't give guidance (acceptable - depends on problem)
**For ε**: ✓ Guidelines (0.1 common, decay schedule)

**Overall Guidance**:
- γ: Task-specific (not hyperparameter)
- α: Problem-dependent (would route to rl-debugging or algorithm-specific skills)
- ε: Start high, decay to low

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill discourages arbitrary tuning for γ and ε, appropriately leaves α to algorithm-specific skills

## Pressure Test 8: Q-Learning vs SARSA Confusion

### Scenario
```
User: "I'm using Q-learning but my agent keeps falling off cliffs during training. Should I switch to SARSA?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 6 (Algorithm Pitfall #3)**:
> "Confusing Q-Learning and SARSA
> 
> Scenario: User uses Q-learning but expects on-policy behavior.
> 
> Example: Cliff walking with epsilon-greedy
> - Q-learning: Learns optimal (risky) path along cliff
> - SARSA: Learns safe path away from cliff (accounts for exploration)
> 
> Takeaway:
> - Q-learning: Learns optimal policy (off-policy)
> - SARSA: Learns policy being followed (on-policy)
> 
> Choose based on whether you want optimal policy or policy that accounts for exploration."

**Part 6 (Q-Learning)**:
> "Key: Off-policy (learns optimal Q regardless of behavior policy).
> 
> When to Use: Model-free, discrete actions, want optimal policy."

**Part 6 (SARSA)**:
> "Difference from Q-learning: Uses next action from policy (on-policy).
> 
> When to Use: When you want policy to reflect exploration strategy."

**Comparison Table**:
| Algorithm | Model? | Episodes? | Convergence | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Q-Learning | No | Partial | Guaranteed* | Discrete actions, off-policy |
| SARSA | No | Partial | Guaranteed* | On-policy, safe exploration |

**Rationalization Table**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Q-learning and SARSA are the same" | Q-learning off-policy, SARSA on-policy | "Q-learning learns optimal, SARSA learns policy followed." |

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Exact scenario (cliff walking)
2. Diagnosis (Q-learning learns risky optimal path)
3. SARSA learns safe path (accounts for exploration)
4. When to choose each
5. Off-policy vs on-policy explanation

**User Can Decide**:
- Want optimal policy (even if risky during training)? → Q-learning
- Want safe policy during training? → SARSA

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill directly addresses cliff walking scenario and explains difference

---

## Pressure Test 9: Exploration at Test Time

### Scenario
```
User: "My agent's test performance is 20% worse than training. Is it overfitting?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 7 (Pitfall #3)**:
> "Exploration at Test Time
> 
> Scenario: Evaluating learned policy with ε-greedy (ε=0.1).
> 
> Problem: Test performance artificially low (10% random actions).
> 
> Solution: Use greedy policy at test time.
> 
> ```python
> # Training
> action = epsilon_greedy(state, Q, epsilon=0.1)
> 
> # Testing
> action = argmax(Q[state, :])  # Greedy, no exploration
> ```
> 
> Takeaway: Exploration is for learning, not evaluation."

**Part 9 (Pitfall #8)**:
> "Exploration at Test Time
> 
> Symptom: Evaluating with ε-greedy (ε > 0).
> 
> Consequence: Test performance artificially low.
> 
> Solution: Greedy policy at test time (ε=0)."

**Rationalization Table**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "I'll test with ε-greedy (ε=0.1)" | Test should be greedy (exploit only) | "Exploration is for learning. Test with ε=0 (greedy)." |

**Red Flag**:
- [ ] **Test Exploration**: Using ε-greedy during evaluation

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Diagnosis (ε=0.1 → 10% random actions)
2. Quantitative match (user sees 20% worse, ε=0.1 could explain part)
3. Solution (greedy at test time)
4. Code example showing training vs testing
5. Red flag to catch this

**User Can Fix**:
- Set ε=0 for testing
- Understand exploration ≠ evaluation
- Distinguish training performance (with exploration) from test (greedy)

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill directly addresses this issue with code example

## Pressure Test 10: Model-Based vs Model-Free Confusion

### Scenario
```
User: "I want to use value iteration on my Atari game. How do I get the transition probabilities P(s'|s,a)?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 6 (Value Iteration)**:
> "When to Use: Small state spaces (< 10,000 states), full model available."

**Part 6 (Algorithm Pitfall #1)**:
> "Using DP Without Model
> 
> Scenario: User tries value iteration on real robot (no model).
> 
> Problem: Value iteration requires P(s'|s,a) and R(s,a,s').
> 
> Solution: Use model-free methods (Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradients).
> 
> Red Flag: 'Let's use policy iteration for Atari games.' (No model available.)"

**Part 6 (Algorithm Families)**:
> "Three Paradigms
> 
> 1. Dynamic Programming (DP):
> - Requires full MDP model (P, R known)
> - Exact algorithms (no sampling)
> - Examples: Value Iteration, Policy Iteration
> 
> 2. Monte Carlo (MC):
> - Model-free (learn from experience)
> - Learns from complete episodes
> - Examples: First-visit MC, Every-visit MC
> 
> 3. Temporal Difference (TD):
> - Model-free (learn from experience)
> - Learns from incomplete episodes
> - Examples: TD(0), Q-learning, SARSA
> 
> Key Differences:
> - DP: Needs model, no sampling
> - MC: No model, full episodes
> - TD: No model, partial episodes (most flexible)"

**Comparison Table**:
| Algorithm | Model? | Episodes? | Convergence | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Value Iteration | Yes (P, R) | No | Guaranteed | Small MDPs, known model |
| Q-Learning | No | Partial | Guaranteed* | Discrete actions, off-policy |

**Rationalization Table**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Value iteration for Atari" | Atari doesn't have model (P, R unknown) | "Value iteration needs full model. Use model-free (DQN)." |

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Clear categorization (DP requires model, TD is model-free)
2. Explicit pitfall ("value iteration for Atari")
3. Comparison table showing model requirement
4. Rationalization entry
5. Guidance to use Q-learning (model-free)

**User Understands**:
- Cannot use value iteration (no model)
- Atari = model-free problem
- Route to Q-learning or DQN (value-based-methods skill)

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill clearly explains model requirement and routes to correct algorithm family

---

## Additional Pressure Test 11: Bellman Equation as Black Box

### Scenario
```
User: "My Q-values aren't converging. I'm using the standard Q-learning update. What's wrong?"
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 4 (Why Bellman Equations Matter)**:
> "1. Iterative Algorithms: Use Bellman equation as update rule
> 2. Convergence Guarantees: Bellman operator is a contraction, guarantees convergence.
> 3. Understanding Algorithms: All RL algorithms approximate Bellman equations.
> 
> Takeaway: Bellman equations are the foundation of RL algorithms."

**Part 4 (Deriving the Bellman Equation)**:
> [Full derivation from value function definition to Bellman equation]
> 
> "Key Insight: Value function satisfies a consistency equation (recursive)."

**Part 6 (Q-Learning)**:
> "Q-learning update (off-policy)
> Q[s][a] += alpha * (r + gamma * max(Q[s_next].values()) - Q[s][a])"

**Part 9 (Pitfall #9)**:
> "Treating Bellman as Black Box
> 
> Symptom: Using Q-learning update without understanding why.
> 
> Consequence: Cannot debug convergence issues, tune hyperparameters.
> 
> Solution: Derive Bellman equation, understand bootstrapping."

**Rationalization Table**:
| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Bellman equation is just a formula" | It's the foundation of all algorithms | "Derive it. Understand why V(s) = r + γV(s'). Enables debugging." |

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Full derivation (not just formula)
2. Convergence guarantees (contraction mapping)
3. Connection to Q-learning update
4. Pitfall explicitly addressing "black box" usage
5. Guidance to derive and understand

**User Can Debug**:
- Check if Bellman backup is correct
- Verify convergence conditions
- Understand why TD error (r + γQ[s',a'] - Q[s,a])

**However**: Skill doesn't provide specific convergence diagnostics (e.g., check if max TD error decreasing).

**Verdict**: ✓ PASS - Skill provides theoretical foundation for debugging, though specific diagnostics would be in rl-debugging skill

---

## Additional Pressure Test 12: Stochastic vs Deterministic Transitions

### Scenario
```
User: "I implemented value iteration but values are wrong. Environment is stochastic (actions succeed 80% of time)."
```

### Expected Guidance (from skill)

**Part 1 (Example 2: Stochastic GridWorld)**:
> "Modification: Actions succeed with probability 0.8, move perpendicular with probability 0.1 each.
> 
> P((1,2) | (1,1), RIGHT) = 0.8  # intended
> P((0,1) | (1,1), RIGHT) = 0.1  # slip up
> P((2,1) | (1,1), RIGHT) = 0.1  # slip down
> 
> Why Stochastic: Models real-world uncertainty (robot actuators, wind, slippery surfaces).
> 
> Consequence: Agent must consider probabilities when choosing actions."

**Part 4 (Bellman Pitfall #2)**:
> "Ignoring Transition Probabilities
> 
> Deterministic Transition:
> V^π(s) = R(s,a) + γ V^π(s')  # Direct, s' is deterministic
> 
> Stochastic Transition:
> V^π(s) = Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + γ V^π(s')]  # Weighted sum
> 
> Example: Stochastic GridWorld
> # Action RIGHT from (1,1)
> V((1,1)) = 0.8 * [r + γ V((1,2))]    # 80% intended
>          + 0.1 * [r + γ V((0,1))]    # 10% slip up
>          + 0.1 * [r + γ V((2,1))]    # 10% slip down
> 
> Takeaway: Don't forget to weight by transition probabilities in stochastic environments."

**Part 6 (Value Iteration Code)**:
> ```python
> value = r + gamma * sum(P(s_next|s,a) * V[s_next[0], s_next[1]])
> ```

**Part 9 (Pitfall #10)**:
> "Ignoring Transition Probabilities
> 
> Symptom: Using deterministic Bellman equation in stochastic environment.
> 
> Consequence: Wrong value estimates.
> 
> Solution: Weight by P(s'|s,a) in stochastic environments."

### Pressure Test Result

**Skill Provides**:
1. Stochastic GridWorld example
2. Explicit P(s'|s,a) probabilities
3. Bellman equation for stochastic case (with Σ)
4. Code example showing summation over next states
5. Pitfall addressing this exact issue

**User Can Fix**:
- Add weighted sum over possible next states

## Rationalization Resistance Analysis

### Mechanisms Used

**1. Explicit Prerequisite Statements**
- "Without this foundation, you're copy-pasting code you cannot debug"
- "Before implementing any RL algorithm, answer..." (checklist)

**2. Concrete Examples of Failure**
- GridWorld with Q=0 initialization (exploration)
- Pong with single frame (Markov violation)
- Cliff walking (Q-learning vs SARSA)

**3. Numerical Demonstrations**
- γ=0.9: 0.9^10 = 0.35 (quantifies impact)
- Greedy: 1.05 vs ε-greedy: 4.62 (empirical comparison)

**4. Pitfall → Symptom → Consequence → Solution**
- Structured approach prevents rationalization
- Example: "Too small γ → can't see long-term goals → increase γ"

**5. Rationalization Table**
- 10 common rationalizations with counter-guidance
- Maps user's wrong thinking to correct understanding

**6. Red Flags Checklist**
- 12 warning signs to catch before implementation
- Forces reflection before proceeding

**7. Comparison Tables**
- Algorithm comparison (shows when each applies)
- Prevents "use X for everything" thinking

## Areas for Enhancement (Optional)

### 1. Supervised Learning vs RL (Pressure Test 4)
**Current**: Addressed indirectly through MDP framework and Bellman equations.

**Enhancement**: Add explicit section:
```markdown
### RL vs Supervised Learning

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Data | Fixed dataset, labels known | Interactive, must explore |
| Labels | True labels (y) | Estimates Q(s,a) (bootstrapped) |
| Objective | Minimize loss on data | Maximize cumulative reward |
| Training | One pass or multiple epochs | Continual interaction |
| Exploration | Not needed | Critical for learning |
```

**Impact**: Would strengthen Pressure Test 4 from partial to full pass.

**Priority**: LOW (skill already comprehensive, this is edge case)

---

### 2. Convergence Diagnostics (Pressure Test 11)
**Current**: Explains Bellman equation and convergence theory.

**Enhancement**: Add practical convergence checks:
```python
# Check convergence
max_td_error = max(abs(r + gamma * V[s_next] - V[s]) for s, r, s_next in experience)
if max_td_error < threshold:
    print("Converged!")
```

**Impact**: Would help debugging in practice.

**Priority**: LOW (belongs more in rl-debugging skill)

---

## Final Assessment

### Strengths

**1. Comprehensive Coverage**: 2,144 lines, 13 parts, all core concepts

**2. Mathematical Rigor**: Full derivations (Bellman equation), formal definitions

**3. Practical Examples**: 5 comprehensive code examples (all runnable)

**4. Pedagogical Flow**: Systematic build-up (framework → computation → algorithms)

**5. Resistance Mechanisms**: Multiple layers (pitfalls, rationalization table, red flags, code examples)

**6. Concrete Scenarios**: Real problems (Pong frame stacking, cliff walking, etc.)

**7. Quantitative**: Numbers not just concepts (γ=0.9^10 = 0.35)

**8. Routing Guidance**: Clear boundaries with other skills

---

### Weaknesses (Minor)

**1. Supervised Learning Comparison**: Could be more explicit (currently indirect)

**2. Learning Rate (α) Guidance**: Mentioned but not deeply covered (acceptable - algorithm-specific)

**3. Convergence Diagnostics**: Theory-heavy, light on practical checks (intentional - belongs in rl-debugging)

---

### Pressure Test Summary

**11/12 Full Pass, 1/12 Partial Pass**

The skill successfully resists rationalization in all tested scenarios:
- ✓ Prevents skipping theory
- ✓ Guides principled γ choice (not arbitrary)
- ✓ Explains why exploration needed (with examples)
- ✓ Distinguishes algorithms clearly
- ✓ Catches common pitfalls before implementation
- ✓ Provides concrete examples and code
