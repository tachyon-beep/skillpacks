Date: 2025-10-30
Status: Pressure testing complete
Tested: 6 high-pressure scenarios requiring deep expertise

---

## Pressure Test 1: DQN or Policy Gradient for Atari?

**Scenario**: User implementing RL for Atari game.

**User Query**: "I want to solve Atari games. Should I use DQN or PPO (policy gradient)? Which is better?"

**Pressure**: Both are valid for discrete actions. User needs decision framework, not generic "either works."

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must convey**:
1. Value methods for discrete actions (appropriate here)
2. Policy gradient also appropriate (different tradeoffs)
3. Sample efficiency + stability considerations
4. DQN strengths: Sample-efficient, off-policy
5. PPO strengths: Stability, easier to tune
6. Decision framework: Use DQN if sample-efficient learning critical, PPO if stability critical

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Part 9, When to Use Each Method**:
```
| Situation | Method | Why |
| Learning method | Basic DQN | Understand target network, replay buffer |
| Medium task | Double DQN | Fix overestimation, minimal overhead |
```

**Part 1, Core Principle**:
"Value-based methods solve discrete action RL by learning Q(s,a)... They're powerful for discrete spaces but require careful implementation"

**Routing to policy-gradient-methods**:
"For large discrete action space (> 1000 actions), consider policy gradient... For exploration by stochasticity, policy gradient useful"

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill distinguishes discrete action suitability, explains decision framework, routes appropriately

**Score**: 5/5 (User gets decision framework, not "just use DQN")

---

## Pressure Test 2: Debugging Unstable DQN Training

**Scenario**: User trained DQN on custom environment, diverges within 1000 steps.

**User Query**: "My DQN completely diverges in the first 1000 steps. Loss becomes NaN or infinite. I've checked the network architecture and it seems right. What systematically causes divergence?"

**Pressure**: Multiple potential causes (target network, learning rate, reward scale, replay buffer). User needs diagnosis methodology, not random guessing.

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must provide**:
1. Systematic diagnosis tree (not random suggestions)
2. Order of checks (most likely first)
3. Clear checks (verifiable in code)
4. Root cause explanation (why each causes divergence)
5. Specific fixes (not "tune hyperparameters")

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Part 7, Bug #1: Training Divergence (Q-values explode)**:
```
Diagnosis Tree:
1. Check target network
   - WRONG: updating every step
   - FIX: use separate target network
2. Check learning rate
   - WRONG: too high (> 0.001)
   - FIX: reduce to 0.0001
3. Check reward scale
   - WRONG: large rewards (> 100)
   - FIX: normalize
4. Check replay buffer
   - WRONG: too small (< 1000)
   - FIX: increase to 100k+
```

**Part 2, Mechanism 2: Target Network**:
"Network updates move both the prediction AND the target, creating instability... Trying to hit a moving target that moves whenever you aim"

**Part 2, DQN Pitfall #1**:
"Symptom: DQN loss explodes immediately, Q-values diverge to ±infinity
Root cause: No target network (or target updates too frequently)"

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill provides clear diagnosis tree, explains each cause, directs to specific fixes

**Score**: 5/5 (User follows tree, identifies root cause)

---

## Pressure Test 3: Rainbow Complexity vs Simple DQN

**Scenario**: User considering whether to implement full Rainbow or simpler DQN.

**User Query**: "I see Rainbow DQN gets best results on Atari. Should I implement Rainbow instead of Double DQN? Or will Double DQN be fine?"

**Pressure**: Rainbow is complex (6 components). Need to balance state-of-the-art vs practical development. User could spend weeks on Rainbow with minimal empirical gain.

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must provide**:
1. Clear component breakdown (what does each component do?)
2. Empirical importance ranking (which matter most?)
3. Recommendation based on task type
4. Learning progression (understand pieces before combining)
5. Honest tradeoff (complexity vs gain)

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Part 6, Rainbow DQN**:
```
Rainbow = Double DQN + Dueling DQN + Prioritized Replay + 3 more innovations

When to Use Rainbow:
- Use Rainbow if: Need state-of-the-art Atari performance
- Use Double + Dueling DQN if: Standard DQN training unstable
- Use Basic DQN if: Learning the method
```

**Part 6, Learning Progression**:
```
1. Q-learning (understand basics)
2. Basic DQN (add neural networks)
3. Double DQN (fix overestimation)
4. Dueling DQN (improve architecture)
5. Add prioritized replay (sample efficiency)
6. Rainbow (combine all)
```

**Part 12, Pressure Test Scenario 3**:
```
Recommendation:
Start: Double DQN
If unstable: Add Dueling
If slow: Add Prioritized
Only go to Rainbow: If need SotA and have time
```

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill gives honest complexity vs gain assessment, provides learning progression, recommends starting simple

**Score**: 5/5 (User understands incremental complexity vs benefit)

---

## Pressure Test 4: Continuous Control - Redirect

**Scenario**: User with continuous action space trying to use value-based RL.

**User Query**: "I have a robot control task with 7 continuous joint angles. Can I discretize the action space and use DQN? How fine should the discretization be?"

**Pressure**: Discretization is fundamentally wrong approach. Combinatorial explosion (10^7 or higher). User needs firm redirect + explanation.

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must provide**:
1. Clear "no" - discretization is wrong
2. Explanation of why (combinatorial explosion)
3. Right algorithm for continuous actions (actor-critic, policy gradient)
4. Redirect to appropriate skill
5. Example of why it fails mathematically

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Core Principle**:
"Do NOT use for: Continuous control (robot arm angles, vehicle acceleration)... Value methods assume you can enumerate and compare all action values. This breaks down with continuous actions (infinite actions to compare)"

**Part 9, Action Space Check**:
```python
if action_space == 'continuous':
    print("ERROR: Use actor-critic or policy gradient")
    print("Value methods only for discrete actions")
    redirect_to_actor_critic_methods()

elif action_space == 'discrete' and len(actions) > 1000:
    print("⚠ Large action space, consider policy gradient")
```

**Pressure Test Scenario 1**:
"No, value methods are discrete-only. Use actor-critic (SAC) or policy gradient (PPO). They handle continuous actions naturally. Discretization would create 7-dimensional action space explosion (e.g., 10 values per joint = 10^7 actions)."

**Routing**:
"Route to actor-critic-methods if: Continuous action space"

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill firmly redirects, explains why discretization fails, points to right algorithms

**Score**: 5/5 (User understands fundamental limitation and gets right solution)

---

## Pressure Test 5: Hyperparameter Tuning Under Uncertainty

**Scenario**: User has unstable training, multiple potential tuning options.

**User Query**: "My DQN training oscillates, learning curve is very noisy. Should I increase batch size, reduce learning rate, increase replay buffer, or change target network update frequency? I can only tune one thing right now."

**Pressure**: Multiple valid options. User needs priority ranking, not "try them all."

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must provide**:
1. Priority ranking (which has most impact?)
2. Effects of each change (what will happen?)
3. Decision criteria (how to choose between them?)
4. Expected improvements (quantitative if possible)

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Part 9, Priority Levels**:
```
Priority 1 (Critical):
- Target network update frequency (1000-5000 steps)
- Replay buffer size (100k+ typical)
- Frame stacking (4 frames)

Priority 2 (Important):
- Learning rate (0.0001-0.0005)
- Epsilon decay schedule (over ~10% of steps)
- Batch size (32-64)

Priority 3 (Nice to have):
- Network architecture (32-64-64 CNN standard)
- Reward normalization (helps but not required)
- Double/Dueling DQN (improvements, not essentials)

Start with Priority 1, only adjust Priority 2-3 if unstable.
```

**Part 8, Hyperparameter Tuning** (each parameter):
- "Too high: divergence, unstable training; Too low: slow learning"
- "Start: value, Adjust if needed"
- "Rule of thumb, adaptive strategy"

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill provides clear priority ranking, enables single-factor tuning decision

**Score**: 5/5 (User tunes priority 1 first, moves systematically)

---

## Pressure Test 6: Overestimation Bias Recognition

**Scenario**: User's Q-values look good but learned policy performs poorly.

**User Query**: "I've trained my DQN carefully. During training, max Q-value is 50 and average is 30. But when I evaluate the learned policy on 100 episodes, average return is only 5. Why is there a 6x gap between Q-values and actual performance?"

**Pressure**: Could be many issues (bad reward function, overestimation, distribution shift). User needs to recognize overestimation bias specifically.

### Skill Response Test

**What skill must provide**:
1. Diagnosis of overestimation bias
2. Explanation of why this gap occurs
3. Solution (Double DQN)
4. How to verify diagnosis
5. Expected improvement quantification

### Skill Passages Addressing This

**Part 3, The Overestimation Bias Problem**:
```
Max operator bias: In stochastic environments, max over noisy estimates is biased upward.

True Q*(s,a) values: [10.0, 5.0, 8.0]
Due to noise, estimates: [11.0, 4.0, 9.0]

Standard DQN takes max: max(Q_estimates) = 11
But true Q*(s,best_action) = 10

Systematic overestimation!
```

**Part 7, Bug #3: Q-Values Too Optimistic**:
```
Symptom: Policy performance much worse than max Q-value during training.

Red Flag: Policy performance >> max Q-value during training.
This 6x gap exactly matches scenario.

Solutions (try in order):
1. Use Double DQN (reduces overestimation)
2. Reduce learning rate (slower updates → less optimistic)
3. Increase target network update frequency (more stable target)
```

**Part 12, Red Flags**:
"[ ] Q-values >> rewards: Overestimation, try Double DQN"

### Validation

✓ **Passes**: Skill identifies overestimation as specific diagnosis, explains mechanism, recommends Double DQN

**Score**: 5/5 (User recognizes pattern, applies targeted fix)

## Rationalization Pressure Tests

### Pressure Test 6a: "Skip Target Network to Save Memory"

**Rationalization**: "Target network doubles memory. I'll skip it to save GPU memory."

**What skill must do**: Explain memory cost is negligible vs stability cost

**Skill Response**:
- Part 2: "Target network prevents moving target problem"
- Part 2, Pitfall #1: "Missing target network causes divergence"
- Part 12, Red Flags: "[ ] No target network: Divergence expected, add it"
- Part 2: Implementation shows minimal memory overhead

✓ **Passes**: Skill shows memory cost negligible, stability critical

---

### Pressure Test 6b: "Rainbow is Just DQN + Tricks"

**Rationalization**: "Rainbow is just adding various improvements to DQN. I understand DQN, so Rainbow must be easy."

**What skill must do**: Explain that components solve specific problems, not arbitrary tricks

**Skill Response**:
- Part 6: "Rainbow = Double DQN + Dueling DQN + Prioritized Replay + 3 more"
- Part 3: Double DQN solves overestimation (specific problem)
- Part 4: Dueling DQN improves feature learning (specific problem)
- Part 5: Prioritized Replay samples important transitions (specific problem)
- Part 12, Pressure Test 3: "Understand components separately before combining"

✓ **Passes**: Skill explains purposefulness of each component

---

### Pressure Test 6c: "Frame Stacking Unnecessary, CNN Sees Motion"

**Rationalization**: "Modern CNNs are so powerful, they can infer velocity from a single frame using architectural features."

**What skill must do**: Explain that single frame mathematically insufficient (Markov property)

**Skill Response**:
- Part 2, Pitfall #3: "Single frame doesn't show velocity"
- Part 2: "Velocity: difference between consecutive frames"
- Part 2: "Network cannot infer: is ball moving left or right? [from single frame]"
- Connected to rl-foundations: "violates Markov property"

✓ **Passes**: Skill explains fundamental information-theoretic requirement
