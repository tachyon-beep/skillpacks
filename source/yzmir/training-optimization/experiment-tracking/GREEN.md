## Test Scenarios Preparation

The SKILL.md is ready for testing against these pressure scenarios:

### Scenario 1: User Doesn't See Value in Tracking
- Covered by: "Track before you need it" principle
- Includes: Murphy's law of ML (best results are untracked)
- Examples: Lost results, wasted reproduction time

### Scenario 2: Tool Choice Confusion
- Covered by: Tool comparison table + decision tree
- Addresses: When to use TensorBoard vs W&B vs MLflow
- Provides: Clear criteria based on use case

### Scenario 3: Reproducibility Claims Without Proper Tracking
- Covered by: Complete tracking requirements (5 categories)
- Includes: Reproducibility test question
- Examples: All components needed for reproducibility

### Scenario 4: Overhead Concerns
- Covered by: Minimal overhead section
- Provides: Frequency guidelines (step, epoch, once)
- Shows: <1% for scalars, 1-5% typical

### Scenario 5: Team Collaboration Without Shared Tracking
- Covered by: Collaboration workflows section
- Addresses: Local-only tracking pitfall
- Solutions: W&B for teams, MLflow server

### Scenario 6: Poor Organization (No Naming Convention)
- Covered by: Organization section with examples
- Provides: Naming convention template
- Shows: Hierarchy for related experiments

### Scenario 7: Incomplete Tracking (Only Metrics)

## Ready for REFACTOR Phase

The SKILL.md is complete and meets all quality standards. Ready to proceed to REFACTOR phase with pressure testing scenarios.

### Anticipated Pressure Points
1. "Tracking adds too much overhead" → Show <1% for scalars
2. "I'll remember my settings" → Show memory failure examples
3. "Which tool should I use?" → Decision tree + table
4. "Print statements work fine" → Show crash scenario
5. "I only need best model" → Show evaluation bug scenario
6. "Tracking is complex" → Show 2-line setup
7. "Team doesn't need to see" → Show collaboration benefits
8. "I'll track later" → Show retroactive tracking is impossible

All pressure points are addressed in SKILL.md with:
- Clear explanations of why the rationalization fails
- Concrete examples showing consequences
- Simple solutions with code examples
- Trade-off discussions where appropriate
