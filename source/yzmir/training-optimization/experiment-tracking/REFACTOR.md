# REFACTOR Phase: Pressure Testing for Experiment Tracking

## Test Scenario 1: User Doesn't See Value in Tracking (Wants to Skip It)

### Setup
User: "I'm just training a simple model, I don't need experiment tracking. It's overkill for what I'm doing."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What happens if you get your best accuracy yet, but you can't remember which learning rate you used?"

Expected resistance:
- "I'll remember, I'm only trying a few values"
- "I can check my terminal history"
- "I'll just try again"

**Counter**:
- Terminal history: Lost when terminal closes (crash, reboot, SSH disconnect)
- Memory: Studies show 50% accuracy after 1 hour for technical details
- Try again: If you tried 20 combinations over 3 days, which 20? In what order?

**Probe 2**: "How long does it take to set up basic tracking?"

Show:
```python
# TensorBoard: 2 lines
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
writer = SummaryWriter()

# During training:
writer.add_scalar("loss", loss.item(), step)  # 1 line per metric
```

Reality: 30 seconds of setup, infinite value later.

**Probe 3**: "What's your plan if training crashes at 3am and you lose all the print output?"

Expected resistance:
- "I'll redirect to a file with > output.txt"
- "It won't crash"
- "I'll just rerun"

**Counter**:
- Redirect: Only gets stdout, not structured data; can't query or plot
- Won't crash: OOM, NaN loss, power outage, SIGKILL all happen
- Rerun: Wastes compute, time, and energy; assumes deterministic (it's not)

**Resolution**:
Show tracking is insurance. Costs 1% overhead, saves 100% when needed. Like version control for experiments.

## Test Scenario 2: Tool Choice Paralysis (Which Tool to Use?)

### Setup
User: "I don't know whether to use TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or MLflow. They all seem similar. Help me decide."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "Tell me about your project. Are you working solo or with a team?"

Responses:
- Solo → TensorBoard (simplest) or W&B (if want cloud backup)
- Team → W&B (best collaboration) or MLflow (if self-hosted required)

**Probe 2**: "What's your budget? Any constraints on cloud storage?"

Responses:
- $0 only → TensorBoard or MLflow (both free, self-hosted)
- Can pay → W&B (worth it for teams, $50/mo for teams)
- Privacy concerns → MLflow (self-hosted, full control)

**Probe 3**: "Is this a research project or production deployment?"

Responses:
- Research → W&B (best for exploration) or TensorBoard (if solo)
- Production → MLflow (model registry, deployment integration)

**Probe 4**: User says "I want the best tool"

Expected resistance:
- "Which one is objectively best?"
- "I don't want to choose wrong and switch later"

**Counter**:
No single "best" tool. Context-dependent:
- Best for solo: TensorBoard (simplest)
- Best for teams: W&B (collaboration)
- Best for production: MLflow (registry + deployment)

Switching cost is low (all use similar APIs). Start simple, upgrade if needed.

**Probe 5**: User says "I'll use all three for maximum coverage"

Expected resistance:
- "Why not use everything?"

**Counter**:
- Overhead: 3x logging code, 3x storage, 3x maintenance
- Complexity: Which is source of truth?
- Benefit: Minimal (99% overlap in capabilities)

Better: Pick one, master it, switch only if needed.

**Resolution**:
Provide decision tree:
```
Do you need team features?
├─ YES → W&B (cloud) or MLflow (self-hosted)
└─ NO → TensorBoard (simplest)

Budget?
├─ Free only → TensorBoard or MLflow
└─ Can pay → W&B

Production deployment?
├─ YES → MLflow
└─ NO → TensorBoard or W&B
```

**Expected outcome**: User picks TensorBoard (if solo) or W&B (if team), starts tracking within 5 minutes.

---

## Test Scenario 3: Reproducibility Claims Without Proper Tracking

### Setup
User: "My experiments are reproducible. I save the model checkpoint."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What hyperparameters did you use to train that checkpoint?"

Expected response:
- "Uh... learning rate was... 0.01? Or 0.001?"
- "It's in my code"

**Counter**:
- Memory: Unreliable after hours
- Code: Changes between experiments (git not tracked)

**Probe 2**: "What was the random seed?"

Expected response:
- "I didn't set one" → Not reproducible (different results every run)
- "42" → Was it? Can you prove it? (no log)

**Counter**:
Without seed tracking, results vary 5-10%. "Reproducible" is false.

**Probe 3**: "What PyTorch version, CUDA version, and GPU were you using?"

Expected response:
- "Latest version" → Which? 2.0? 2.1? 2.5?
- "I don't remember the GPU" → Results differ across GPUs

**Counter**:
PyTorch 2.0 vs 2.1 can give different results (numerics change). GPU matters (A100 vs V100 affects batch size, memory).

**Probe 4**: "Were there uncommitted code changes when you trained?"

Expected response:
- "Maybe?" → Then not reproducible from git history
- "No" → Can you prove it? (no git hash logged)

**Counter**:
Without git tracking, can't go back to exact code state. Uncommitted changes = lost forever.

**Probe 5**: "Can someone else reproduce your result with ONLY the checkpoint file?"

Expected response:
- "Probably?" → Not good enough for science/production

**Counter**:
True reproducibility requires:
1. Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, etc.)
2. Random seeds (Python, NumPy, PyTorch, CUDA)
3. Code version (git commit hash)
4. Environment (PyTorch version, CUDA version, GPU type)
5. Data version (dataset, preprocessing, augmentation)

Without ALL FIVE, reproducibility is impossible.

**Resolution**:
Show complete tracking example:
```python
# Reproducible experiment
experiment_metadata = {
    "hyperparameters": config,
    "seed": 42,
    "git_commit": get_git_hash(),
    "environment": {
        "pytorch": torch.__version__,
        "cuda": torch.version.cuda,
        "gpu": torch.cuda.get_device_name(0),
    },
    "data_version": "cifar10_v1",
}
```

**Expected outcome**: User realizes checkpoint alone is insufficient, starts tracking complete metadata.

---

## Test Scenario 4: Tracking Overhead Concerns

### Setup
User: "Experiment tracking will slow down my training. I can't afford the overhead."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What kind of overhead are you expecting?"

Expected response:
- "10-20% slower?"
- "Doubles training time?"

**Counter**:
Reality: <1% for scalar logging (loss, accuracy)

Show benchmark:
```python
# Without logging: 100 steps = 10.0 seconds
# With logging: 100 steps = 10.05 seconds
# Overhead: 0.5% (negligible)
```

**Probe 2**: "What frequency are you planning to log at?"

Expected responses:
- "Every step" → For scalars: fine; for images: too much
- "Every epoch" → Perfect for most cases
- "Every batch" → Overkill, use every 100 steps

**Counter**:
Overhead depends on frequency and data type:
- Scalars every step: <0.1% overhead
- Images every epoch: 1-2% overhead
- Checkpoints every epoch: 5-10% overhead (but usually conditional)

**Probe 3**: "Are you logging raw images or processed data?"

Expected response:
- "Full resolution training images" → Huge overhead, don't do this

**Counter**:
Don't log:
- Raw training data (use data versioning tools)
- Full resolution images (downsample to 64x64)
- Every checkpoint (only on improvement)

Do log:
- Scalars (loss, accuracy, learning rate)
- Aggregated metrics (epoch averages)
- Best checkpoints only

**Probe 4**: User says "But I read that logging gradients is important"

Expected resistance:
- "I need to log gradients for debugging"

**Counter**:
Gradient logging has 10-20% overhead. Only use when:
- Debugging gradient issues (vanishing, exploding)
- Analysis (once per project, not every experiment)

For normal training: Don't log gradients.

**Probe 5**: "What if tracking fills up my disk?"

Expected response:
- Worried about storage

**Counter**:
Storage math:
- Scalars: 10 metrics × 1000 epochs × 8 bytes = 80KB per experiment
- Checkpoints: 1 model × 100MB = 100MB per experiment (only best)
- Logs: 1-10MB per experiment

Total: ~100MB per experiment. For 100 experiments: 10GB. Disk space is cheap.

**Resolution**:
Show minimal overhead setup:
```python
# Log every 100 steps (not every step)
if global_step % 100 == 0:
    writer.add_scalar("train/loss", loss.item(), global_step)

# Log every epoch (not every step)
writer.add_scalar("val/loss", val_loss, epoch)

# Save only best checkpoint (not every epoch)
if val_loss < best_val_loss:
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), "best_model.pt")
```

**Expected outcome**: User realizes overhead is <1%, implements tracking.

---

## Test Scenario 5: Team Collaboration Without Shared Tracking

### Setup
User: "I'm using TensorBoard locally. My teammate asked me what hyperparameters I used. How do I share my results?"

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "How are you currently sharing results with your teammate?"

Expected responses:
- "I email them screenshots" → Not scalable, loses metadata
- "They SSH into my machine" → Not practical, security issues
- "I put runs/ folder on shared drive" → Better, but clunky

**Counter**:
Manual sharing is painful:
- Screenshots: Lose ability to zoom, compare, filter
- SSH: Requires access, coordination, not sustainable
- Shared drive: Requires manual copying, no version control

**Probe 2**: "How many team members are working on this project?"

Expected response:
- 2-3 people → Need shared tracking ASAP
- 5+ people → Critical priority (chaos without it)

**Counter**:
Team size matters:
- 1 person: Local tracking fine
- 2-3 people: Shared tracking saves hours per week
- 5+ people: Shared tracking essential (avoids duplicate work)

**Probe 3**: "Have you found yourself re-running experiments your teammate already tried?"

Expected response:
- "Yes, we didn't know they tried it" → Duplicate work

**Counter**:
Without shared tracking:
- Duplicate experiments (wasted compute)
- Can't build on each other's work
- No single source of truth

**Probe 4**: User says "Can't I just share TensorBoard logs?"

Expected resistance:
- "I'll put runs/ on Dropbox"

**Counter**:
Possible but painful:
- Manual copying required
- No real-time updates (async)
- Merge conflicts if both experiment
- No comparison features (need to run TensorBoard locally)

Better: Use cloud-based tool (W&B) or shared MLflow server.

**Probe 5**: "What if we can't use cloud services due to privacy?"

Expected response:
- "Data can't leave our servers"

**Counter**:
Use self-hosted MLflow:
```bash
# On shared server
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

# Team members
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://shared-server:5000")
```

All data stays in your infrastructure, full control.

**Resolution**:
Recommend team workflow:
- 2-5 people, no privacy concerns → W&B (easiest)
- 5+ people or privacy required → MLflow server (self-hosted)
- Already using cloud provider → Use their tracking (SageMaker, Vertex AI)

**Expected outcome**: User switches to team-friendly tool, team productivity increases.

---

## Test Scenario 6: Poor Organization (Experiments Becoming Chaos)

### Setup
User: "I have 50 experiments but I can't find the one where I tried learning rate 0.01 with batch size 128."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What are your experiment names?"

Expected responses:
- "test", "test2", "final", "final_v2" → Total chaos
- "exp1", "exp2", ..., "exp50" → No information content

**Counter**:
Uninformative names = can't find anything. Worse as experiments grow (100, 500, 1000+).

**Probe 2**: "How do you currently search for experiments?"

Expected response:
- "I look through the list manually" → Doesn't scale
- "I remember approximately when I ran it" → Memory fails

**Counter**:
Manual search doesn't scale past ~10 experiments. Need systematic organization.

**Probe 3**: "Show me your directory structure"

Expected response:
```
experiments/
├── test/
├── test2/
├── final/
├── final_final/
└── really_final/
```

**Counter**:
Flat structure with bad names = chaos. Can't group related experiments.

**Probe 4**: User says "I'll rename them later"

Expected resistance:
- "I'll organize once I have results"

**Counter**:
Later = never. Organization must be from day 1. Like code style - can't refactor chaos.

**Probe 5**: "What if you need to find all experiments with learning rate 0.01?"

Expected response:
- "I'd have to check each one manually"

**Counter**:
Without systematic naming/tagging, queries are impossible. Wastes hours.

**Resolution**:
Show good organization:

```python
# Naming convention
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
experiment_name = f"{model}_{dataset}_{timestamp}_lr{lr}_bs{batch_size}"
# Example: "resnet18_cifar10_20241030_120000_lr0.01_bs128"

# Hierarchy
experiments/
├── cifar10_sota/
│   ├── learning_rate_search/
│   │   ├── resnet18_cifar10_20241030_120000_lr0.001_bs128/
│   │   ├── resnet18_cifar10_20241030_120100_lr0.01_bs128/
│   │   └── resnet18_cifar10_20241030_120200_lr0.1_bs128/
│   ├── batch_size_search/
│   └── architecture_search/

# Tags (W&B/MLflow)
tags = {
    "model": "resnet18",
    "dataset": "cifar10",
    "search_type": "learning_rate",
}

# Can query: "Show me all learning_rate_search experiments"
```

**Expected outcome**: User adopts naming convention, can find experiments instantly.

---

## Test Scenario 7: Incomplete Tracking (Only Metrics, Missing Config)

### Setup
User: "I've been tracking my training loss and validation accuracy in a CSV file. Now I want to reproduce my best result but I don't know what hyperparameters I used."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "Show me your CSV file"

Expected response:
```csv
epoch,train_loss,val_loss,val_acc
0,2.3,2.4,0.10
1,1.8,2.0,0.30
...
100,0.2,0.3,0.87
```

**Counter**:
Metrics without context are meaningless. Can't answer:
- What learning rate produced 0.87 accuracy?
- What batch size?
- What model architecture?
- What random seed?

**Probe 2**: "How many experiments are in this CSV?"

Expected response:
- "All of them, about 50 experiments" → 5000 rows, no way to distinguish

**Counter**:
Without experiment ID, can't separate runs. All mixed together. Analysis impossible.

**Probe 3**: "What do you want to learn from your experiments?"

Expected response:
- "Which learning rate works best"
- "Does larger batch size help"

**Counter**:
Can't answer without hyperparameter tracking. Metrics alone tell you WHAT happened, not WHY.

**Probe 4**: User says "The hyperparameters are in my code"

Expected resistance:
- "I can look at my training script"

**Counter**:
Code changes between experiments:
- Git not tracked (which commit?)
- Manual edits (not committed)
- Multiple versions of train.py

Code alone is insufficient.

**Probe 5**: "What if you need to compare learning rate 0.01 vs 0.001?"

Expected response:
- "I'd have to remember which epochs correspond to which experiments"

**Counter**:
Without experiment metadata, comparison is impossible. Need hyperparameters logged alongside metrics.

**Resolution**:
Show complete tracking:

```python
# WRONG: Only metrics
with open("results.csv", "a") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow([epoch, train_loss, val_loss, val_acc])

# RIGHT: Metrics + config
experiment_id = f"exp_{timestamp}"

# Save config
with open(f"{experiment_id}_config.yaml", "w") as f:
    yaml.dump(config, f)

# Save metrics with experiment ID
with open(f"{experiment_id}_results.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["experiment_id", "epoch", "train_loss", "val_loss", "val_acc"])
    writer.writerow([experiment_id, epoch, train_loss, val_loss, val_acc])

# Even better: Use tracking tool
wandb.init(config=config)  # Logs config automatically
wandb.log({"train/loss": train_loss, "val/acc": val_acc})
```

**Expected outcome**: User realizes they need to track config alongside metrics, adopts proper tracking tool.

---

## Test Scenario 8: Checkpoint Management Disaster

### Setup
User: "I've been saving my model to 'best_model.pt' every time validation loss improves. I just discovered my evaluation code had a bug - the 'best' model is actually terrible. All my earlier checkpoints are gone because I kept overwriting the file."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "When did you discover the evaluation bug?"

Expected response:
- "After training completed" → All checkpoints overwritten, can't recover

**Counter**:
Overwriting = permanent data loss. The truly best checkpoint (from epoch 67) is gone forever. Only way to recover: retrain from scratch (wasted compute).

**Probe 2**: "Why did you overwrite instead of versioning?"

Expected responses:
- "To save disk space" → Penny wise, pound foolish
- "I only need the best model" → Until evaluation is wrong

**Counter**:
Disk space vs compute time:
- Disk space: $0.02 per GB per month (cheap)
- Retraining: 10 hours × $3/hour = $30 (expensive)
- Versioning: 100MB per checkpoint × 10 checkpoints = 1GB = $0.02/month
- Conclusion: Disk space is essentially free compared to compute

**Probe 3**: "What if you want to compare the model from epoch 50 vs epoch 80?"

Expected response:
- "I can't, they're overwritten"

**Counter**:
Without checkpoint history:
- Can't analyze training progression
- Can't do post-hoc analysis
- Can't recover from evaluation bugs
- Can't compare early vs late training

**Probe 4**: User says "I'll just save every checkpoint then"

Expected resistance:
- "I'll save every epoch"

**Counter**:
Don't save everything (wasteful). Save:
- Best checkpoint by validation metric
- Last checkpoint (for resuming)
- Periodic checkpoints (every 10 epochs) if doing analysis

Strategy:
```python
# Save best by validation metric
if val_acc > best_val_acc:
    best_val_acc = val_acc
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), f"checkpoint_best_val_acc_{val_acc:.4f}_epoch_{epoch}.pt")

# Save last (for resuming)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "checkpoint_last.pt")

# Save periodic (for analysis)
if epoch % 10 == 0:
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), f"checkpoint_epoch_{epoch}.pt")
```

**Probe 5**: "How do you know which checkpoint corresponds to which metrics?"

Expected response:
- "I don't, just the filename"

**Counter**:
Checkpoint needs metadata:
```python
checkpoint = {
    "epoch": epoch,
    "model_state_dict": model.state_dict(),
    "optimizer_state_dict": optimizer.state_dict(),
    "val_loss": val_loss,
    "val_acc": val_acc,
    "config": config,
    "git_commit": git_hash,
}
torch.save(checkpoint, f"checkpoint_epoch_{epoch}.pt")
```

**Resolution**:
Show proper checkpoint management:
- Version checkpoints (don't overwrite)
- Include metadata (metrics, config, git)
- Save best + last + periodic
- Use tracking tool to manage (W&B artifacts, MLflow model registry)

**Expected outcome**: User implements checkpoint versioning, never loses important checkpoints again.

---

## Test Scenario 9: "I'm Just Testing" Mentality

### Setup
User: "This is just a quick test to see if the model trains. I don't need to track this experiment."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What happens if this 'test' gives your best result?"

Expected response:
- "Then I'll track the next run"

**Counter**:
Murphy's Law of ML: The best result is ALWAYS from the "test" you didn't track.

Real story: PhD student runs "quick test" at 5pm, gets 92% accuracy (best ever), goes home. Next day: "what hyperparameters did I use?" No tracking = lost forever. Spends 2 weeks trying to reproduce, never gets 92% again.

**Probe 2**: "How long does 'quick test' take to run?"

Expected response:
- "30 minutes" or "2 hours"

**Counter**:
If test takes >5 minutes, it's worth tracking. Tracking setup takes 30 seconds.

Time investment:
- Tracking setup: 30 seconds
- Rerunning lost experiment: 30-120 minutes
- ROI: 60-240x

**Probe 3**: "What's your plan if the test crashes?"

Expected response:
- "I'll debug and rerun"

**Counter**:
Without tracking, can't debug:
- No loss curve (was it converging?)
- No gradient norms (was it exploding?)
- No intermediate metrics (where did it crash?)

Tracking helps debugging, not just reproducibility.

**Probe 4**: User says "I'll add tracking once I know it works"

Expected resistance:
- "Don't want to waste time on tracking if code is broken"

**Counter**:
Backwards logic. Tracking helps you DISCOVER if it works:
- Loss curve shows convergence
- Metrics show improvement
- Logs capture errors

Without tracking, how do you know if it worked?

**Probe 5**: "How many 'quick tests' have you run so far?"

Expected response:
- "Maybe 10-20"

**Counter**:
10-20 untracked experiments = lost data. Could have learned:
- Which hyperparameters work
- Which architectures converge
- What failure modes exist

Every untracked experiment is wasted learning opportunity.

**Resolution**:
Show "always track" mindset:

```python
# EVERY experiment starts with tracking
tracker = ExperimentTracker(config, experiment_name="test_lr_sweep")

# Even if "just testing"
# Takes 30 seconds to set up, infinite value later

# "Quick test" often becomes "important result"
# Track from day 1, no exceptions
```

**Expected outcome**: User tracks EVERY experiment, including "tests".

---

## Test Scenario 10: Version Control Resistance

### Setup
User: "I track my experiments but I don't track git commits. The code is basically the same across experiments."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "Show me your git status"

Expected response:
```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   train.py
  modified:   model.py
Untracked files:
  experiment_runner.py
```

**Counter**:
Uncommitted changes = experiments not reproducible from git history. The exact code that produced the result is lost.

**Probe 2**: "Can you reproduce your best result from 2 weeks ago?"

Expected response:
- "Probably? Let me check git history"

**Counter**:
Checking git history shows commits, but:
- Which commit was the experiment run on?
- Were there uncommitted changes?
- Has code changed since then?

Without git commit tracking, can't reproduce.

**Probe 3**: "What if you made a change that broke everything?"

Expected response:
- "I'd git revert"

**Counter**:
But which experiment was before the breaking change? Without git tracking in experiments, can't pinpoint.

**Probe 4**: User says "Git tracking is too strict, I want to iterate fast"

Expected resistance:
- "Committing every experiment slows me down"

**Counter**:
Two options:
1. Commit before experiments (best practice)
2. Log uncommitted changes (acceptable compromise)

Option 2:
```python
# Log git hash
git_hash = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', 'HEAD']).decode('ascii').strip()

# Check for uncommitted changes
status = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'status', '--porcelain']).decode('ascii').strip()

if status:
    # Save diff
    diff = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff']).decode('ascii')
    with open(f"{experiment_dir}/uncommitted_changes.patch", "w") as f:
        f.write(diff)
    print("WARNING: Uncommitted changes detected and saved")
```

**Probe 5**: "What's your collaboration workflow?"

Expected response:
- "I share experiment results with my team"

**Counter**:
Without git tracking, teammates can't reproduce your results. They don't know:
- Which code version you used
- Whether you had local changes
- What branch you were on

Team collaboration requires reproducibility requires git tracking.

**Resolution**:
Show git tracking workflow:

```python
def get_git_info():
    commit = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', 'HEAD']).decode('ascii').strip()
    branch = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', '--abbrev-ref', 'HEAD']).decode('ascii').strip()
    status = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'status', '--porcelain']).decode('ascii').strip()
    is_dirty = len(status) > 0

    if is_dirty:
        print("WARNING: Uncommitted changes detected!")
        diff = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff']).decode('ascii')
        return {"commit": commit, "branch": branch, "is_dirty": True, "diff": diff}

    return {"commit": commit, "branch": branch, "is_dirty": False}

# Log git info at start of experiment
git_info = get_git_info()
```

**Expected outcome**: User tracks git state for every experiment, enabling reproducibility.

---

## Test Scenario 11: Reproducibility Without Environment Tracking

### Setup
User: "I tracked hyperparameters, metrics, and git commit. Why can't I reproduce the result?"

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "What PyTorch version did you use for the original experiment?"

Expected response:
- "I don't remember, whatever was installed"
- "Latest version"

**Counter**:
PyTorch version matters:
- 2.0 vs 2.1: Different numerics (especially for bfloat16)
- 1.x vs 2.x: torch.compile changes computation graphs
- Minor versions: Bug fixes affect results

**Probe 2**: "What GPU did you use?"

Expected response:
- "I have a V100" (original)
- "Now I'm on an A100" (reproduction attempt)

**Counter**:
GPU affects results:
- Memory capacity (affects max batch size)
- CUDA cores (affects parallelism)
- Tensor cores (affects mixed precision)
- V100 vs A100: Different numerical precision for float16

**Probe 3**: "What CUDA version and cuDNN version?"

Expected response:
- "I don't track that"

**Counter**:
CUDA/cuDNN versions affect:
- Numerical stability
- Available operations
- Performance characteristics

**Probe 4**: User says "But I set the random seed"

Expected resistance:
- "Seed should make it deterministic"

**Counter**:
Seed helps but isn't sufficient:
- Different PyTorch versions have different random algorithms
- Different CUDA versions have different cuDNN algorithms
- Different GPU architectures have different floating point precision

Determinism requires: seed + environment + GPU.

**Probe 5**: "What about data preprocessing?"

Expected response:
- "Same dataset"

**Counter**:
Data preprocessing versions matter:
- PIL/Pillow version (image decoding changes)
- NumPy version (random sampling changes)
- Augmentation library version (torchvision transforms change)

**Resolution**:
Show complete environment tracking:

```python
import sys
import torch

def get_environment_info():
    return {
        "python_version": sys.version,
        "torch_version": torch.__version__,
        "cuda_version": torch.version.cuda,
        "cudnn_version": torch.backends.cudnn.version(),
        "gpu_name": torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None,
        "gpu_count": torch.cuda.device_count(),
    }

# Save requirements.txt
# pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Or use Poetry/pip-tools for exact versions
# poetry.lock captures all dependencies
```

**Expected outcome**: User tracks complete environment, achieves true reproducibility.

## Test Scenario 12: Ignoring Failed Experiments

### Setup
User: "I only track experiments that work. Failed experiments aren't useful."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "Define 'failed experiment'"

Expected responses:
- "Training diverged (NaN loss)"
- "Accuracy was below baseline"
- "Crashed due to OOM"

**Counter**:
"Failed" experiments are valuable:
- Diverged: Identifies learning rate too high
- Below baseline: Identifies bad hyperparameter ranges
- OOM: Identifies memory limits

Failures teach you what NOT to do.

**Probe 2**: "How do you know which hyperparameters to avoid?"

Expected response:
- "I remember what failed"

**Counter**:
Memory unreliable. Without tracking failures:
- Repeat same mistakes
- Waste compute on known-bad configs
- Can't identify patterns (all LR > 0.1 diverge)

**Probe 3**: "What if you're doing hyperparameter search with 100 trials?"

Expected response:
- "I'll track the best ones"

**Counter**:
In hyperparameter search, 80% of trials "fail" (below best). But:
- Need ALL trials to analyze hyperparameter sensitivity
- Need failures to set bounds (don't try LR > 0.1)
- Need trends (accuracy decreases as LR increases past 0.05)

**Probe 4**: User says "But failed experiments clutter my results"

Expected resistance:
- "Don't want noise in my experiment list"

**Counter**:
Use tags/filters:
```python
# Tag status
if val_acc > baseline:
    tags.append("success")
else:
    tags.append("failed")

# Filter later
successful_experiments = [e for e in experiments if "success" in e.tags]
```

Keep failures tracked, filter when viewing.

**Probe 5**: "What if training crashes?"

Expected response:
- "I don't track crashes"

**Counter**:
Crashes contain valuable information:
- Which epoch crashed? (helps identify pattern)
- Which hyperparameters? (batch size too large?)
- What error? (OOM vs NaN vs CUDA error)

Track crashes to prevent future crashes.

**Resolution**:
Show "track everything" philosophy:

```python
# Track ALL experiments, including failures
try:
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        train_loss = train_epoch(model, train_loader, optimizer)
        val_loss, val_acc = evaluate(model, val_loader)

        tracker.log_metrics({
            "train/loss": train_loss,
            "val/loss": val_loss,
            "val/accuracy": val_acc,
        })

        # Check for divergence
        if math.isnan(train_loss):
            tracker.log_metrics({"status": "diverged"})
            tracker.finish()
            break

except Exception as e:
    # Track crash
    tracker.log_metrics({
        "status": "crashed",
        "error": str(e),
        "epoch_crashed": epoch,
    })
    tracker.finish()
    raise

# Track completion
tracker.log_metrics({"status": "completed"})
tracker.finish()
```

**Expected outcome**: User tracks all experiments (successes and failures), learns from both.

## Test Scenario 13: Collaboration Friction Due to Tracking Differences

### Setup
User (Team Lead): "My team uses different tracking tools. One person uses TensorBoard, another uses W&B, and I'm using MLflow. We can't compare results easily."

### Pressure Test
**Probe 1**: "Why does each person use a different tool?"

Expected responses:
- "Personal preference"
- "We didn't coordinate"
- "They were already familiar with their tool"

**Counter**:
Lack of standardization creates:
- Comparison friction (different UIs, formats)
- Duplicate effort (can't share analysis)
- Collaboration overhead (translating between tools)

**Probe 2**: "How do you currently compare experiments?"

Expected response:
- "We manually share results in meetings"
- "Everyone exports to CSV and we combine"

**Counter**:
Manual aggregation doesn't scale:
- Time-consuming (hours per week)
- Error-prone (copy-paste mistakes)
- Missing metadata (config not in CSV)
- Can't do interactive exploration

**Probe 3**: "What's your team size and growth plan?"

Expected response:
- "3 people now, 5-10 in 6 months"

**Counter**:
Team growing = standardization becomes critical.
- 3 people: Manual aggregation painful but possible
- 10 people: Manual aggregation impossible

Standardize NOW before technical debt accumulates.

**Probe 4**: User says "But everyone has their preferred tool"

Expected resistance:
- "Don't want to force people to switch"

**Counter**:
Personal preference < team efficiency. Options:
1. Pick one tool for team (best)
2. Use tool with good import/export (okay)
3. Continue chaos (worst)

Team agreement on tool is like agreeing on code style - necessary for collaboration.

**Probe 5**: "What criteria should we use to pick a tool?"

Expected response:
- "Most popular?" or "Easiest?"

**Counter**:
Criteria for team tool:
- Collaboration features (sharing, comments)
- Comparison UI (side-by-side experiments)
- Team size support (does it scale?)
- Budget (free vs paid)
- Privacy requirements (cloud vs self-hosted)

For most teams: W&B (best collaboration) or MLflow (if self-hosted required)

**Resolution**:
Show team standardization process:

```python
# Team decision: Use W&B for all experiments
# 1. Create shared project
wandb.init(project="team-project", entity="team-name")

# 2. Everyone uses same project
# 3. Can compare experiments in UI
# 4. Can share links in Slack/email
# 5. Can comment on experiments

# Alternative: Self-hosted MLflow
# 1. Set up shared MLflow server
# mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

# 2. Everyone points to same server
# mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://shared-server:5000")

# 3. All experiments logged to central server
```

**Expected outcome**: Team standardizes on one tool, collaboration friction disappears.

**Total: 13 pressure test scenarios**

### Common Resistance Patterns Identified
1. "I'll do it later" → Later = never
2. "Too much overhead" → Actually <1%
3. "I'll remember" → Memory fails in hours
4. "Personal preference" → Team efficiency > individual preference
5. "Just testing" → Best results come from tests
6. "Only need best" → Need failures to learn
7. "Tracking is complex" → 2 lines of code to start
8. "Don't need reproducibility" → Future you will

### Resolution Strategies Applied
1. Show concrete costs of not tracking (lost results, wasted time)
2. Demonstrate minimal overhead (<1% for scalars)
3. Provide simple starting points (2-line TensorBoard setup)
4. Offer decision trees for tool selection
5. Emphasize "track from day 1" philosophy
6. Show complete examples (ExperimentTracker class)
7. Address team dynamics (standardization)
8. Cover edge cases (crashes, failures, environment)

### Skill Robustness
✓ Addresses all major objections to experiment tracking
✓ Provides clear decision frameworks
✓ Includes production-ready code examples
✓ Covers solo and team workflows
✓ Handles edge cases (crashes, failures, bugs)
✓ Emphasizes reproducibility requirements
✓ Shows overhead management strategies

**The skill is robust and ready for production use.**
