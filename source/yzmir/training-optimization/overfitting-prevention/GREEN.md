### Pitfalls Coverage (10 documented)

Each pitfall includes:
- User's rationalization
- Reality
- Evidence or example
- Specific fix

1. **Only training accuracy** → Gap metric essential
2. **Dropout everywhere** → Architecture-specific selection
3. **Over-regularization** → Systematic combination strategy
4. **Data collection over regularization** → Regularization is faster
5. **Early stopping dismissal** → Standard in industry
6. **Validation set as luxury** → Essential for diagnosis
7. **Removing batch norm** → Not the problem
8. **Augmenting validation** → Breaks metrics
9. **Regularization overhead** → Actually saves compute
10. **Overfitting unavoidable** → Preventable with proper technique combination

### Rationalization Table (10 items)

| User's Belief | Truth | Evidence | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Train 95% = working | Need validation too | Train 95%, val 65% common | Check both metrics |
| More training helps | Stops at peak | Val loss increases after epoch 50 | Enable early stopping |
| Collect more data | Regularize first | 5K + good reg = 85% vs 90% with 50K | Try regularization |
| Dropout=0.5 standard | Architecture dependent | Works MLP not CNN | Tune based on results |
| Batch norm + dropout | Can conflict | Unpredictable interaction | Use one or other |
| Augment validation | Breaks metrics | Val acc inflated, test fails | Clean validation only |
| Adam weight_decay works | Broken in Adam | Adam vs AdamW different | Use AdamW |
| Early stopping is amateur | Industry standard | Every competitive model uses it | Enable with patience=10 |
| More data required | Regularization solves | 5K + techniques achieves 80%+ | Combine techniques |
| Parameters > examples | Unpreventable overfitting | 1000x ratio guarantees overfitting | Reduce capacity |

### Red Flags (8 documented)

Each red flag includes:
- What it means
- Immediate action
- Diagnosis checklist (3-4 items)

1. **Validation loss increasing, training decreasing** → Enable early stopping
2. **Train improving but validation declining sharply** → Stop now, use earlier checkpoint
3. **Training unstable, loss spiking** → Reduce learning rate
4. **Great on training, terrible on test** → Severe overfitting or distribution shift
5. **Validation plateaued but still training** → Enable early stopping with patience=20
6. **Train loss very low, validation loss very high** → Reduce model capacity
7. **Hyperparameter sensitivity** → Use cross-validation
8. **Works in validation, fails in production** → Check for distribution shift

### Architecture-Specific Guidance

**CNNs (Computer Vision)**:
- Typical problem: Train 98%, Val 75% on small dataset
- Fix order: Early stopping → L2 → augmentation → capacity reduction
- Anti-pattern: Dropout after conv layers

**Transformers (NLP, Vision)**:
- Typical problem: Large model (100M params) on small dataset (5K examples)
- Fix order: Early stopping → L2 → label smoothing → augmentation
- Anti-pattern: Dropout (modern transformers don't use it)

**RNNs/LSTMs (Sequences)**:
- Typical problem: Train loss decreasing, val loss increasing
- Fix order: Early stopping → dropout → L2 → augmentation + recurrent dropout
- Anti-pattern: Standard dropout (use recurrent dropout instead)

### Decision Frameworks

#### Detection Decision Tree
- Gap < 3%: No overfitting
- Gap 3-10%: Mild, can accept or prevent
- Gap 10-20%: Moderate, needs prevention
- Gap > 20%: Severe, immediate action required

#### Technique Combination Framework
- Primary cause → primary fix
- Secondary cause → secondary fix
- Measure improvement systematically
- Don't add conflicting techniques

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart
- Start with early stopping (universal)
- Check model capacity vs data size
- Add L2 if applicable
- Add augmentation if applicable
- Reduce capacity if gap still > 10%
- Collect more data if still failing

### Verification Standards

**Measured Improvements** (from examples):
- Early stopping alone: 5-15% validation improvement
- L2 regularization: 1-3% validation improvement
- Data augmentation: 2-5% validation improvement
- Capacity reduction: 3-8% validation improvement
- Combination of all: 15-20% validation improvement

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Small dataset (1K examples): Can achieve 75-85% with proper regularization
- Medium dataset (10K examples): Can achieve 85-90% with light regularization
- Large dataset (100K examples): Overfitting unlikely with standard approach
